# DICOM-Print-and-Management-System
The DICOM Print and Management System is designed to provide comprehensive DICOM printing, PACS integration, security, and image management capabilities. Key features include:

DICOM Printing:

Windows Print Service Integration: Direct integration with Windows Print API for commercial inkjet/laser printers, auto-detection of installed printers, and a dedicated DICOM PRINT Windows service with proper user rights.
Print Layout Configuration: Predefined page templates (e.g., Single image, 2x2 grid, 1+3 comparison, modality-specific presets), customizable margins, orientation, and image scaling (Fit-to-Page, Actual Size). Multi-image fitting with auto-arrangement by modality and manual drag-and-drop rearrangement in print preview.
Branding & De-identification: User logo upload with positioning and scaling, pixel-based templated overlay masks for de-identification (e.g., blackout patient name/date), prebuilt templates, and custom text fields with variables.
Print Output Formats: Direct printing to configured Windows printers, generation of PDF/A-3 compliant files with optional embedded DICOM metadata and AES-256 password protection, and direct email attachment of PDFs/images via SMTP with prefilled templates.
DICOM PACS Integration:

Storage & Retrieval: Auto-routing of incoming studies to local folders, and Query/Retrieve functionality by Study Date, Modality, or Patient ID.
Configuration: Management of PACS servers via a JSON configuration file.
DICOM Security:

Data Protection: AES-256 encryption for the local database and masking of PHI in logs.
Access Control: Role-based permissions (e.g., Technician: View/Print, Admin: Edit Metadata) and a session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.
DICOM Metadata Viewing/Editing:

Viewer: A basic viewer for image preview, group-wise metadata display (Patient, Study, Series, Equipment), and search functionality for specific tags.
Editing: Restricted editing of non-critical tags with an audit trail for modifications.
Supporting Functional Requirements:

DICOM Image Viewing: Support for monochrome and color DICOM rendering, multi-frame support, modality-specific rendering protocols (windowing, inversion), and display of overlay annotations/measurements. <<$Change>>Performance targets include loading images up to 500MB within 3 seconds on standard hardware, and for larger images (up to 2GB), initiating display of the first frame or a low-resolution preview within 5 seconds with progressive loading.<<$Change>> Optional GPU-accelerated rendering. UI features include side-by-side comparison and a thumbnail grid.
DICOM File Management: Drag-and-drop import from various sources, export to JPEG/PNG, hierarchical storage, tag-based search, and DICOM compliance validation during import.
DICOM Network Communication: Support for DICOM C-ECHO, C-STORE (SCU/SCP), C-FIND, C-MOVE with configurable AE Titles, ports, and transfer syntaxes. Includes error handling with retries and logging, and auto-rejection of non-DICOM files.
DICOM Data Manipulation: Basic tools like zoom, rotation, pan, flip, and Window Level adjustment with presets. Non-destructive annotations (arrows, text, ROI) stored in DICOM GSPS, and measurement tools (length, angle, area).
DICOM Compliance: Provision of a DICOM Conformance Statement and validation via DVTk.
Workflow Optimization: Customizable hanging protocols and keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
User Interface (UI): Three main tabs (Incoming/Print Queue, Local Storage, Query/Retrieve), Dark/Light theme toggle, and high-contrast mode for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliant).
Settings Page: Configuration for system (storage path, auto-purge, network proxy), user preferences (annotation colors, windowing presets), print settings (page size, printer, logo, overlays, email), and anonymization profiles.
Anonymization: DICOM metadata anonymization (manual/preset profiles, pseudonymization) and pixel anonymization (overlay shapes/text, save templates).
Non-Functional Requirements:

Performance: Application launch within 5 seconds on HDD and 3 seconds on SSD. Handling of 10+ concurrent DICOM transfers. PDF generation within 10 seconds for 50-page documents.
Compatibility: Compatible with Windows 10/11 printers and Adobe Acrobat Reader 9+ for generated PDFs.
Security: Anonymized outputs meet HIPAA Safe Harbor, TLS for SMTP and web portal API calls, password-protected PDFs for PHI, and OWASP Top 10 compliance.
Localization: Support for English (default) and Spanish (UI only, Phase 1).
Assumptions & Dependencies:

Assumes availability of Odoo web portal APIs for license management and preconfigured DICOM-compliant PACS servers.
Dependencies include .NET 6+ Desktop Runtime, fo-dicom library, and SQLite for local storage.
Out-of-Scope: Development of Odoo web portal, AI-based image analysis, 3D reconstruction, EHR integration, custom printer drivers, and advanced DICOM-compliant print pipelines.
