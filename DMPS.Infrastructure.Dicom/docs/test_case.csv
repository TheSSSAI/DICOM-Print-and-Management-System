Test must validate that a failed login does not provide specific error details (e.g., 'user not found' vs 'wrong password').","Login process should complete in < 2 seconds as per REQ-1-077.","Login form must be fully navigable via keyboard."
"TEST-DICOM-101","DICOM Ingestion","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end DICOM C-STORE ingestion pipeline correctly processes and persists a study.","Critical - Failure means the system cannot receive patient data, rendering it useless.","High","Windows Service, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL are all running and correctly configured.","1. Use a DICOM SCU tool (e.g., DCMTK's storescu) to send a multi-file DICOM study to the service's configured AETitle and port. 2. Monitor the RabbitMQ management UI to confirm a message is published to the main queue. 3. Verify the message is consumed. 4. Query the PostgreSQL database to confirm records for Patient, Study, Series, and Image have been created. 5. Check the configured storage path on the file system to confirm the DICOM files exist in the correct hierarchical folder.","The DICOM study is successfully received, its metadata is persisted to the database, and its files are stored on the file system. The C-STORE operation returns a success code to the SCU quickly, before DB persistence is complete.","A valid, multi-file DICOM study.","DCMTK (storescu), RabbitMQ Management UI, PostgreSQL Client (psql)","6","24","8","C-STORE SCP Listener (TASK-3001), RabbitMQ Integration (TASK-3002), DB Writer Service (TASK-3003)","Integration environment with all dependencies.","End-to-end processing completes successfully.

"TEST-SEC-005","Security & Compliance","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that Protected Health Information (PHI) is correctly masked in all Serilog log outputs.","Critical - Failure to mask PHI is a direct HIPAA violation, leading to severe legal and financial penalties.","Medium","Serilog is configured with the custom PHI masking enricher.","1. Trigger an application event that logs an object containing PHI (e.g., log a 'DICOM study received' message with Patient Name and Patient ID properties). 2. Capture the log output from the configured sinks (rolling file and Windows Event Log). 3. Inspect the JSON or text output of the log entry. 4. Verify that the values for 'PatientName' and 'PatientID' have been replaced with a redaction mask (e.g., '***REDACTED***').","All log entries containing PHI fields must show the redacted value, not the original plaintext value.","A sample data object containing properties with PHI-like names (PatientName, PatientID).","xUnit, In-memory log sink for testing","3","8","2","Serilog Configuration and PHI Masking Enricher (TASK-1005)","CI/Integration Environment","100% of defined PHI tags are redacted in all log sinks.","Critical - HIPAA compliance failure.","Every build","Low","Delete test log files.","This test is the primary validation for the PHI logging security control (REQ-1-039).","Redaction logic should add negligible overhead to logging.","N/A"
"TEST-VIEWER-001","DICOM Viewer","Functional","E2E","High","","Low","Verify that the interactive image manipulation tools (Zoom, Pan, Window/Level) are responsive and function correctly.","High - Poor viewer performance or incorrect tool behavior directly impacts clinical usability and user satisfaction.","High","A DICOM study is loaded into the viewer.","1. Scroll the mouse wheel up and down to zoom in and out. 2. Click and drag with the left mouse button to pan the image. 3. Click and drag with the right mouse button to interactively adjust window/level. 4. Observe the image rendering during all interactions.","All interactions (zoom, pan, WW/L) must result in smooth, real-time updates to the rendered image without any noticeable lag, tearing, or visual artifacts.","A large DICOM series (e.g., >500 slices CT) to test performance under load.","Manual testing","4","","","Interactive Tooling Implementation (TASK-4004)","Staging environment with a machine meeting recommended hardware specs.","UI response time for interactions is under 500ms per REQ-1-077.

"TEST-IPC-001","Inter-Process Communication","Functional","Integration","High","true","High","Verify the asynchronous task submission workflow using Named Pipes for status check and RabbitMQ for queuing.","Medium - Failure decouples the UI from the backend, preventing long-running tasks like printing from being initiated.","High","Windows Service is running. RabbitMQ is available.","1. Client application initiates a task (e.g., Print). 2. Verify the client makes a synchronous Named Pipe call to the service. 3. Verify it receives a 'PONG' response. 4. Verify the client then publishes a persistent message to the correct RabbitMQ queue. 5. Stop the Windows Service. 6. Client application initiates the same task. 7. Verify the Named Pipe call times out. 8. Verify the UI control (e.g., 'Print' button) is disabled and a message is not sent to RabbitMQ.","The client correctly uses Named Pipes to gate access to RabbitMQ publishing, preventing tasks from being queued when the backend service is unavailable.","A serializable command object for the RabbitMQ message.","xUnit, Moq (for UI layer)","4","16","4","Named Pipes IPC (TASK-1004), RabbitMQ Abstractions (TASK-1003)","CI/Integration environment.","Test passes for both service-running and service-stopped scenarios.","Medium - Prevents all asynchronous tasks.","Every build","Low","Clear any messages from the RabbitMQ queue.","Named Pipe should be secured to only allow local user access.","Named Pipe status check should complete in < 100ms.","N/A"
