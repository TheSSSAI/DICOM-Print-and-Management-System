"Phase 1 - Foundational Services & Critical Paths","High","4","250","xUnit, Moq, Testcontainers, DCMTK","300","Critical - Enables CI/CD and provides rapid feedback on core stability.","10 hours/month","8","Setup CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) with triggers for unit and integration tests.","98% pass rate for unit tests. 95% pass rate for integration tests. CI pipeline runs in <15 minutes.","Stability of integration test environment. Learning curve for Testcontainers.","Use Docker Compose to define environment. Pair programming sessions for new tools.","Ensures core architecture is stable and provides a safety net for all future development."
"Phase 2 - E2E User Journeys & Performance","Medium","6","100","Appium with WinAppDriver, Custom C# Performance Harness","200","High - Reduces manual regression testing effort by ~70% before each release.","15 hours/month","24","Provision dedicated Staging environment for E2E test runs. Setup performance monitoring.","Automated regression suite covers all critical user journeys. Performance benchmarks are automatically validated.","Brittleness of UI tests. Complexity of setting up WinAppDriver in CI.","Use stable, unique IDs for UI elements. Start with a small number of critical E2E tests and expand.","Increases release confidence and catches cross-component regressions."
