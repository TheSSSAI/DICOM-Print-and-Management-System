This requirement defines the physical persistence mechanism for DICOM objects. The 'IDicomFileStorage' interface encapsulates all file system interactions, providing a clean abstraction for the application layer.

### 1.3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

#### 1.3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

##### 1.3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

##### 1.3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

The C-STORE SCP must handle at least 10 simultaneous associations.

##### 1.3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The SCP implementation must be highly concurrent and non-blocking. The C-STORE handler should perform minimal work and immediately hand off the received file to a separate processing queue (as shown in SEQ-EVP-002), freeing up the DICOM listener thread.

##### 1.3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Use of asynchronous programming models is mandatory.
- The callback/event pattern is essential to decouple reception from processing.

##### 1.3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

#### 1.3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

##### 1.3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

##### 1.3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Must support DICOM TLS for secure communication.

##### 1.3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The implementations of both 'IDicomScpService' and 'IDicomScuService' must include conditional logic to configure and enable TLS based on application settings. This involves handling certificates and using the secure port variants of 'fo-dicom''s client and server classes.

##### 1.3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Certificate management and configuration must be handled.
- The choice to use TLS must be driven by external configuration.

##### 1.3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This security requirement necessitates a more complex implementation that can operate in both secure and insecure modes, adding configuration and certificate handling responsibilities.

#### 1.3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

##### 1.3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Maintainability

##### 1.3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

All usage of the 'fo-dicom' library must be contained within this repository.

##### 1.3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

This repository acts as a strict facade, meaning no other part of the application can reference 'fo-dicom' directly. This simplifies dependency management and makes future upgrades or replacements of the DICOM library a localized effort.

##### 1.3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- The public interfaces of this repository must not expose 'fo-dicom'-specific types where possible, favoring native .NET types or application-level DTOs.

##### 1.3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This architectural constraint is a key driver for the repository's existence and directly improves the long-term maintainability and modularity of the system.

### 1.3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is purpose-built to satisfy all DICOM-related functional and non-functional requirements. Its interface-driven design maps directly to key features like data ingestion, PACS query/retrieve, and anonymization. The NFRs for performance and security are primary drivers for the internal implementation strategy.

##### 1.4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Facade/Adapter

##### 1.4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The entire repository acts as a Facade over the 'fo-dicom' library, exposing a simplified, use-case-driven set of interfaces ('IDicomScpService', 'IDicomScuService', etc.) to the application layer. This adapts the complex, low-level 'fo-dicom' API into a more manageable and domain-aligned contract.

##### 1.4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- DicomScpService
- DicomScuService
- DicomAnonymizer
- DicomFileStorage

##### 1.4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Concrete classes within this repository will implement the public interfaces and contain all the logic for interacting with 'fo-dicom''s 'DicomServer', 'DicomClient', and 'DicomDataset' objects.

##### 1.4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for enforcing the architectural constraint of isolating the third-party library, which improves maintainability, testability, and reduces coupling across the application.

#### 1.4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

##### 1.4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Strategy

##### 1.4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Used within the 'IDicomAnonymizer' implementation to handle different de-identification profiles ('Basic De-ID', 'Full De-ID').

##### 1.4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- DicomAnonymizer

##### 1.4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The 'Anonymize' method will accept a parameter specifying the profile. Internally, a dictionary or factory will select the appropriate strategy object (e.g., a class implementing 'IAnonymizationRuleSet') to apply the correct set of tag removal or modification rules.

##### 1.4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The Strategy pattern provides a clean, extensible way to manage different sets of business rules for anonymization without cluttering the main service class with conditional logic.

## 1.7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

### 1.7.1.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

#### 1.7.1.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

#### 1.7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The C-STORE SCP's performance requirement of handling 10 simultaneous associations is a critical implementation challenge. A naive implementation that processes files synchronously within the 'fo-dicom' event handler will fail to meet this NFR and create a significant bottleneck.

#### 1.7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

The implementation must follow the decoupled pattern shown in SEQ-EVP-002, where the SCP handler does minimal work (e.g., save to a temp location) and immediately passes the file path to a robust, asynchronous processing pipeline (e.g., a message queue).

#### 1.7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

#### 1.7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to design the SCP for high concurrency will render the system unable to handle realistic data ingestion loads from modern imaging modalities, violating a core performance requirement.

### 1.7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

#### 1.7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Dependency

#### 1.7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The C-MOVE retrieval process (SEQ-INT-010) creates an implicit, asynchronous dependency loop. The 'IDicomScuService' (typically used by the client) sends a C-MOVE request that causes an external PACS to send data to the 'IDicomScpService' (hosted by the background service).

#### 1.7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

The system must be designed to handle this. The client application needs a way to monitor the progress of the C-STORE operations that result from its C-MOVE request to provide user feedback. This is not just a fire-and-forget operation.

#### 1.7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

#### 1.7.2.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This highlights the complexity of the DICOM protocol. The system's overall design must account for this asynchronous, multi-part workflow to provide a coherent user experience for PACS retrieval.

## 1.8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

### 1.8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is based on a complete review of the provided REPO-06-DIC definition, cross-referenced with the Layered Architecture specification, Quality Attributes, and detailed sequence diagrams (SEQ-EVP-002, SEQ-INT-010) to validate responsibilities and interaction patterns.

### 1.8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Determined repository is a pure Infrastructure Adapter based on 'must_not_implement' constraints.
- Identified Facade and Strategy as key implementation patterns based on 'technology_standards' and functional requirements.
- Confirmed the critical importance of the asynchronous, decoupled SCP design by linking the 'performance_requirements' NFR with the 'SEQ-EVP-002' sequence diagram.

### 1.8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated that 'no database interaction' is a hard constraint, which simplifies the repository's responsibilities significantly.
- Validated that the consumers listed ('REPO-10-BGW', 'REPO-08-APC') align logically with the services provided (SCP/Storage for background service, SCU/Anonymizer for client actions).

### 1.8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- The exposed interfaces ('IDicomScpService', etc.) were checked against their usage in sequence diagrams ('SEQ-EVP-002', 'SEQ-INT-010') to ensure consistency.
- The dependencies ('REPO-01-SHK', 'REPO-03-LOG') were confirmed to provide the necessary context (DTOs) and cross-cutting support (Logging) without violating architectural boundaries.

This pattern is natively supported and optimized by .NET's built-in 'Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection' container, allowing for flexible service registration and resolution at runtime.\n- **Framework-Native Architectural Principle 2 (Resilient Asynchronous I/O with Managed Clients)**: All external I/O operations within infrastructure services must fully embrace .NET's 'async/await' pattern and 'CancellationToken' for non-blocking execution, enhanced responsiveness, and efficient resource utilization. This is critically combined with 'IHttpClientFactory' for managing HTTP client lifetimes and integrating 'Polly' for robust transient fault handling (e.g., retries, circuit breakers) directly into the client pipeline.\n- **Version-Optimized Architectural Principle 3 (Configuration-Driven Adaptability and Modern Language Features)**: Infrastructure component behaviors, connection details, and external service configurations will be entirely driven by the '.NET 8.0 IConfiguration' system, leveraging 'IOptions<T>' for strongly-typed, immutable configuration objects. This enables seamless environment-specific adjustments without code changes. Furthermore, C# 12 features like primary constructors will be utilized for succinct and clear dependency injection in infrastructure services, enhancing readability and maintainability.\n-   **Technology-Specific Quality Principle (Observable, Testable, and Secure Infrastructure)**: Each infrastructure component will be meticulously designed for isolation, enabling effective unit testing (using mocking frameworks like Moq) and comprehensive integration testing against actual or containerized external dependencies (e.g., Testcontainers for databases). 'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging' will be configured for structured and contextual logging, 'Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks' for real-time monitoring of external dependencies, and sensitive configuration data will be secured using 'IConfiguration' providers (e.g., Azure Key Vault), ensuring a robust, observable, and secure .NET infrastructure.\n\n\n\n# Layer enhancement Instructions\n## Infrastructure REPOSITORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR RabbitMQ.Client v6.8.1, System.IO.Pipes\n\n- Technology-Informed Structural Thinking Steps\n{\n  \"thinking_steps\": [\n    {\n      \"step\": \"Understand Infrastructure's Core Structural Requirements\",\n      \"details\": \"Identified the primary organizational patterns, directory structures, and file organization conventions specific to Infrastructure repositories.

These handle 'IConnectionFactory', 'IConnection', 'IModel' directly.\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Settings/'**: Strongly-typed configuration classes (e.g., 'RabbitMQSettings.cs' for host, port, credentials, vhost, retry policies).\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Serializers/'**: Classes for message serialization/deserialization (e.g., 'JsonMessageSerializer.cs', 'BinaryMessageSerializer.cs').\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Messages/'**: DTOs or models representing the actual messages exchanged via RabbitMQ (both inbound and outbound).\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Extensions/'**: 'ServiceCollection' extension methods for easily registering RabbitMQ services ('RabbitMQServiceCollectionExtensions.cs').\n*   **'/Pipes/'**: Contains all System.IO.Pipes-specific infrastructure components.\n    *   '/Pipes/Interfaces/'**: Defines interfaces for pipe servers and clients (e.g., 'INamedPipeServer', 'INamedPipeClient').\n    *   '/Pipes/Implementations/'**: Concrete implementations for named pipe servers and clients (e.g., 'NamedPipeServer.cs', 'NamedPipeClient.cs'). Handles 'NamedPipeServerStream', 'NamedPipeClientStream'.\n    *   '/Pipes/Settings/'**: Strongly-typed configuration classes (e.g., 'PipeSettings.cs' for pipe name, direction, buffer size, security).\n    *   '/Pipes/DataContracts/'**: DTOs or models representing data exchanged over pipes.\n    *   '/Pipes/Extensions/'**: 'ServiceCollection' extension methods for registering pipe services ('PipeServiceCollectionExtensions.cs').\n*   **'/Resilience/'**: Contains generic or technology-specific resilience policies (e.g., 'PollyRetryPolicy.cs' or a specific 'RabbitMQRetryPolicy.cs') for connection re-establishment or message retries, using 'Polly' for a robust approach.\n*   **'/Common/'**: Utility classes or base components shared across different infrastructure concerns.\n\nCritical RabbitMQ.Client v6.8.1, System.IO.Pipes-optimized interfaces with other components:\n*   **'IMessageProducer' (from /RabbitMQ/Interfaces/)**: Exposes methods like 'PublishAsync(string routingKey, T message)' to the Application layer, abstracting RabbitMQ-specific 'IModel.BasicPublish' details and message serialization.\n*   **'IMessageConsumer' (from /RabbitMQ/Interfaces/)**: Defines methods like 'StartConsuming(Func<T, Task> messageHandler)' for the Application layer to register callbacks for incoming messages, abstracting 'EventingBasicConsumer' and message deserialization.\n*   **'INamedPipeServer' (from /Pipes/Interfaces/)**: Offers methods like 'StartAsync()' and 'SendMessageAsync(string message)' for external components to initiate listening and send data over a named pipe, abstracting 'NamedPipeServerStream' complexities.\n\nFor this Infrastructure repository type with RabbitMQ.Client v6.8.1, System.IO.Pipes, the JSON structure should particularly emphasize:\n-   **'TechnologySpecificFolders'**: Grouping files under '/RabbitMQ/' and '/Pipes/' subdirectories to clearly delineate the specific technology being used and its related components, optimizing for modularity and maintainability.\n-   **'SettingsAndConfiguration'**: Dedicated 'Settings' folders within each technology's module (e.g., '/RabbitMQ/Settings/RabbitMQSettings.cs') to centralize technology-specific configuration, aligning with 'Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration' patterns for externalized and manageable settings.\n-   **'AsynchronousProgrammingModels'**: Structuring all service methods to return 'Task' or 'ValueTask', enforcing the modern C# asynchronous programming model ('async/await') for all I/O bound operations, which is critical for message brokers and stream-based communication.\n-   **'DependencyInjectionExtensions'**: Providing 'ServiceCollection' extension methods ('RabbitMQServiceCollectionExtensions.cs', 'PipeServiceCollectionExtensions.cs') at the root of each technology's module or a common 'Extensions' folder, enabling straightforward registration of all infrastructure services in the host application's DI container.\n
