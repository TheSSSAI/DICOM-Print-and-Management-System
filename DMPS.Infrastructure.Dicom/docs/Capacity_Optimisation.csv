"Cross-training","Mid-level developer has low utilization (35%) and opportunity to upskill.","Formally assign the Mid-level developer to pair program with the Senior Backend developer on TASK-3003 (DB Writer) and TASK-5002 (Print Consumer) for at least 50% of the task duration.","Reduces key person dependency on the Senior Backend dev by 30% and increases team bus factor. Improves code quality through paired review.","","Sprint 2","Mid-level developer can independently fix a medium-complexity bug in the data ingestion or printing pipeline by the end of the project.","Increased team resilience and knowledge sharing, reducing risk of future project delays."
"Risk Mitigation","Extreme dependency on a single developer for the project's most complex component (DirectX Viewer).","Make 'Architectural Decision Record (ADR) and Technical Documentation' an explicit, estimated, and tracked sub-task of the high-risk technical spike (TASK-4001).","Creates a knowledge asset that would be critical for another developer or contractor to take over the work, reducing the impact of the key person risk from 'Critical' to 'High'.","4","Sprint 1","A developer unfamiliar with the project can explain the rendering pipeline's architecture using only the documentation produced.","Reduces potential project stall time from months to weeks in a key-person departure scenario."
