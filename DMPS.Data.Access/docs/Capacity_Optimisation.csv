"Resource Leveling","Workload is unevenly distributed, with Frontend/Backend devs overloaded in some sprints and QA/Lead underloaded in others.","Re-balance the plan. Move non-dependent, lower-priority tasks from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3 to alleviate the 104% utilization bottleneck. Have QA assist with developer-level testing.","Smooths utilization to a sustainable ~80% per sprint, reducing risk of burnout and improving predictability.","8","1 day","No developer has >90% planned utilization in any single sprint.","Avoids an estimated 2-week delay caused by burnout, saving ~$18,000 in resource costs."
"Cross-training","RISK-006: Only one developer can implement the critical GPU rendering pipeline.","Mandate that the Frontend Developer pair-programs with the Lead Developer for at least 50% of TASK-DICOM-003 (20 hours).","Creates a backup resource, mitigates key-person dependency, and improves code quality through continuous review.","20","2 weeks","The Frontend developer can independently fix a medium-complexity bug in the rendering pipeline.","Reduces risk of project failure from 50% to 15%, preserving the project's entire value."
