"RISK-001","Technical","The custom GPU-accelerated DICOM viewer using Vortice.Windows (DirectX) may suffer from critical bugs, memory leaks, graphics driver incompatibilities, or fail to meet performance targets, jeopardizing a core application feature.","4","5","20","High","WI-015, WI-016, WI-017","High technical complexity of DirectX interop in WPF, dependency on a low-level library, and sensitivity to hardware/driver variations.","Build a technical spike/prototype of the viewer in Sprint 1 to validate the approach and identify performance bottlenecks. Assign developers with proven graphics programming experience. Implement extensive memory profiling and testing on diverse hardware configurations.","Develop a simpler, software-based rendering fallback path (e.g., using WPF's WritableBitmap). This will have lower performance but ensures the application remains functional if the GPU renderer is too unstable for release.","Prototype fails to render a 500-frame CT series at 30fps. Memory usage grows continuously during viewer interaction. Crashes are reported on specific Nvidia/AMD/Intel GPUs during testing.","Lead Developer","2025-02-15","Open"
"RISK-002","Deployment","The installer's custom prerequisite check for live PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ connections, being a complex task within MSIX, may fail on diverse customer environments, blocking installation and leading to a poor user experience and high support costs.","5","5","25","Critical","WI-026","Inherent difficulty of creating robust custom UI and actions within the MSIX installer framework, coupled with environmental variables (firewalls, network latency, permissions).","Develop a standalone configuration utility that is launched by the installer, instead of embedding the logic directly into the MSIX package. This utility can have a richer UI and more robust error handling. Thoroughly document manual configuration steps.","If the automated check proves unreliable, remove it from the installer for the initial release. Rely on a comprehensive deployment guide and a post-install configuration tool. Provide a PowerShell script for customers to self-test their environment.","Installer fails on more than 10% of clean test VMs with varied network configurations. The development effort for the custom installer exceeds 3 weeks.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-01","Open"
"RISK-003","Security","The custom PHI masking logic in Serilog could have a flaw that fails to redact sensitive patient information in certain edge cases, leading to a HIPAA violation and severe legal/financial penalties.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-011","Complexity of identifying all possible formats and locations of PHI within structured and unstructured log messages. Overlooking a single DICOM tag or log message format could lead to a data leak.","Implement a multi-layered redaction strategy: use a deny-list for specific property names (e.g., 'PatientName') and a pattern-based redaction for values that look like PHI. Create a dedicated suite of unit tests with sample log messages containing PHI in various formats and assert that the output is fully redacted. Conduct a formal code review of the redaction logic by a security-focused developer.","In the event of a suspected leak, have a documented incident response plan to immediately disable logging, patch the redaction logic, and perform a security audit of all existing logs.","A manual or automated scan of log files in the staging environment reveals any unmasked PHI. A new feature that logs data is added without updating the redaction test suite.","Security Champion","2025-02-20","Open"
"RISK-004","Technical","The decoupled C-STORE SCP architecture, while good for performance, creates a risk of data inconsistency between the file system and the database if the persistence consumer service fails after saving the file but before committing the database transaction.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-012, WI-013","Lack of distributed transaction support between file system operations and database writes. A crash or error at the wrong moment can leave 'orphan' files on disk that are not referenced in the database.","Implement an 'outbox pattern' for the file move. The consumer first writes the metadata to the DB with a 'Pending' status, then moves the file, and finally updates the status to 'Completed'. A separate cleanup job can periodically scan for and handle 'Pending' records that are older than a certain threshold. Ensure the RabbitMQ consumer logic is idempotent.","Create a scheduled background task or an admin-facing utility that performs data integrity checks, comparing database records against the file system to identify and report on any orphan files or missing records for manual reconciliation.","The data integrity check report shows an increasing number of mismatches between the database and the file store. Messages are frequently being redelivered from the RabbitMQ queue.","Lead Developer","2025-03-10","Open"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project requires a rare combination of specialized skills (WPF, DirectX, DICOM/fo-dicom, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MSIX). A key person dependency exists, and the loss of a developer with critical expertise (especially in DirectX/Vortice) could severely delay the project.","3","5","15","High","WI-015, WI-026, WI-012, WI-003","Over-reliance on one or two senior developers who possess the unique skills needed for the most complex parts of the system. Lack of cross-training and documentation.","Enforce paired programming on the most complex work items (WI-015, WI-026). Mandate that all complex components have detailed technical design documents. Actively cross-train team members by rotating them through different parts of the codebase during the development cycle.","If a key developer is lost, immediately de-prioritize non-essential features and re-allocate remaining resources to the critical path. Engage a specialized external consultant for short-term support on the affected technology (e.g., DirectX) while hiring a replacement.","Only one developer is committing code to the DicomViewerControl or the MSIX installer project over a 4-week period. Technical documentation for a critical component is not created by the end of the sprint in which it was built.","Project Manager","2025-01-30","Open"
"RISK-006","Quality","The implementation of the DICOM Grayscale Softcopy Presentation State (GSPS) for annotations may not be fully compliant with the DICOM standard, leading to interoperability issues when these objects are viewed in other DICOM applications.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-017","The DICOM standard is notoriously complex and strict. Creating compliant objects from scratch, even with a library like fo-dicom, is error-prone. Inadequate testing against reference viewers can lead to subtle non-compliance.","Use a well-known, open-source DICOM validation tool as part of the CI/CD pipeline to automatically validate all generated GSPS objects. Test the generated GSPS files for compatibility with at least two other major third-party DICOM viewers.","If full GSPS compliance proves too time-consuming, scope could be reduced to save annotations in a proprietary format alongside the DICOM files for internal use only, with a clear warning on export that annotations may not be visible externally.","Generated GSPS files fail validation in the CI pipeline or do not display correctly in a third-party viewer like RadiAnt or Horos.","QA Lead","2025-04-01","Open"
"RISK-007","Technical","The global inactivity monitor for the session lock feature, which requires low-level P/Invoke calls to Windows APIs, could cause instability, high CPU usage, or interfere with other applications, negatively impacting the user experience.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-009","P/Invoke (platform invoke) is inherently fragile. Incorrectly implemented hooks can lead to memory leaks, application crashes, and unpredictable behavior, especially across different versions of Windows.","Use a well-vetted, mature third-party library that abstracts away the P/Invoke calls for global input monitoring. Isolate the monitoring logic in its own thread to minimize the impact on the UI thread. Conduct performance profiling specifically focused on the monitor's CPU and memory footprint.","If the global hook proves unstable, switch to a less comprehensive but safer method, such as monitoring mouse/keyboard activity only when the application window has focus. This reduces security coverage but improves stability.","Users report application freezes or sluggishness after the session lock feature is implemented. The application's CPU usage is consistently high (>5%) even when idle.","Lead Developer","2025-03-15","Open"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The complexity of multiple high and critical work items (WI-015, WI-026, WI-012, WI-013, WI-009, WI-010, WI-020) is underestimated, leading to significant schedule slippage across the project.","4","4","16","High","All High/Critical WIs","Optimism bias in estimation and the cumulative effect of unforeseen challenges in multiple, genuinely difficult technical areas. A delay in one critical path item cascades to others.","Break down all 'High' and 'Critical' complexity work items into smaller, more granular sub-tasks with estimates of no more than 2 days each. Prioritize the highest-risk items (like the viewer prototype) early in the project to gain clarity and de-risk the timeline sooner. Maintain a 15-20% buffer in the project schedule for unforeseen issues.","If a major delay is identified, conduct a re-planning session with the product owner to identify features that can be moved to a subsequent release (e.g., advanced print layouts, email integration) to protect the core feature set's delivery date.","Velocity of completed story points is less than 70% of the planned velocity for two consecutive sprints. A critical work item is more than 50% over its original time estimate.","Project Manager","2025-02-01","Open"
"RISK-009","External","The external Odoo REST API for license validation may become unavailable or change its contract, causing the application to fall into a restricted read-only mode for legitimate users after the 72-hour grace period expires.","3","4","12","Medium","REQ-1-011, REQ-1-073","Dependency on an external service outside the project team's control. Network failures, server downtime, or unannounced API changes can all lead to validation failures.","Implement robust client-side caching of the last known valid license status. Use a resilient HTTP client library (like Polly) with configurable retry and circuit-breaker policies. Establish a clear communication channel and SLA with the team managing the Odoo API.","If the API is down for an extended period, be prepared to issue a client-side patch that extends the grace period or temporarily bypasses the license check. This should be a signed, controlled update.","The license validation endpoint fails with a 5xx error for more than an hour. The API returns a new, unexpected response format that the client cannot parse.","Development Team","2025-04-10","Open"
"RISK-010","Operational","The system's reliance on pre-installed PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ means that misconfigurations by the customer (e.g., incorrect permissions, disabled pgcrypto, wrong RabbitMQ vhost) will lead to application failure and complex, time-consuming support investigations.","4","3","12","Medium","REQ-1-002, REQ-1-076, WI-026","Shifting the responsibility for critical infrastructure setup to the end-user or their IT department, who may not be experts in these technologies.","Enhance the System Health Dashboard (WI-023) to perform deep, specific configuration checks (e.g., 'Can connect to DB?', 'Is pgcrypto enabled?', 'Can write to queue?', 'Is DLX configured?'). Provide a detailed Deployment Guide with a step-by-step checklist and a troubleshooting section for common errors.","Create a standalone diagnostic CLI tool that customers can run to test their environment and generate a report to send to the support team. This can pinpoint the exact misconfiguration without requiring remote access.","The support team receives more than 5 tickets in the first month related to initial environment setup. The prerequisite check in the installer (WI-026) is frequently bypassed manually.","Support Lead","2025-04-20","Open"
"RISK-011","Quality","The end-to-end testing of asynchronous workflows (e.g., printing, C-STORE ingestion) is complex, making it difficult to write reliable automated tests and potentially leaving critical bugs in the error handling or data processing paths.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-003, WI-012, WI-013, WI-019, WI-020","The asynchronous, multi-component nature (Client -> RabbitMQ -> Service -> DB/Printer) of these workflows makes them difficult to test in an automated, deterministic way. It's hard to assert the final state and test failure modes like message redelivery or DLQ routing.","Design for testability: ensure all asynchronous messages have a unique Correlation ID for tracing. Use an in-memory or containerized version of RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL (e.g., using Testcontainers) for integration tests to create a fully controlled test environment. Implement health check endpoints in the service that tests can poll to wait for a specific state.","If E2E automated tests prove too flaky, supplement them with a rigorous, scripted manual testing plan for each asynchronous workflow, to be executed before every release. The script must cover success, failure, and retry scenarios.","Integration tests for asynchronous workflows have a failure rate of over 20% due to timing issues. A critical bug related to message processing is found in UAT or post-release.","QA Lead","2025-03-25","Open"
"RISK-012","Technical","The use of Named Pipes for synchronous IPC may run into security or permission issues in locked-down corporate environments, preventing the client from checking the service status.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-004, WI-019, WI-023","Named Pipes rely on Windows security ACLs. A client running as a standard user may not have the rights to connect to a pipe created by a service running as a different user (e.g., Local System) if the ACLs are not configured correctly.","During the service's pipe server initialization, programmatically set an explicit, less restrictive ACL on the named pipe that grants access to the 'Authenticated Users' group. Clearly document this behavior and any security implications.","If Named Pipes prove problematic, replace them with a local loopback HTTP REST endpoint hosted by the service for status checks. This is more universally compatible with firewalls and permissions, though it has slightly higher overhead.","During UAT, users on standard corporate SOEs report that the 'Print' button is always disabled, and the health dashboard shows the service as 'Unavailable' despite it being running.","Lead Developer","2025-03-05","Open"
"RISK-013","Security","The requirement to store all secrets (database passwords, API keys) in Windows Credential Manager ties the application's configuration to the machine and the user context the service runs under, making deployment and configuration management more complex and error-prone than using config files.","2","4","8","Medium","REQ-1-084","Secrets stored in Credential Manager are not easily portable or scriptable. This complicates automated deployments, disaster recovery, and debugging configuration issues, as the secrets are not in a human-readable or easily transferable format.","Provide a documented, scripted setup process (PowerShell) for provisioning the necessary secrets in the Windows Credential Manager during deployment. The application startup logic must provide very clear log messages if a required secret cannot be found.","For environments where Credential Manager is not suitable (e.g., automated CI/CD), allow for an alternative secret management mechanism, such as environment variables or an encrypted configuration section, enabled by a specific configuration switch.","The application fails to start on a new deployment due to a missing credential. The deployment process requires manual GUI interaction on the server to set up credentials, making it non-repeatable.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-15","Open"
"RISK-014","Timeline","The scope for administrative features (user management, password policies, PACS config, auto-routing rules, data retention, health dashboard, audit viewer) is very large and may be underestimated, potentially delaying the delivery of core clinical features.","3","3","9","Medium","EPIC-005","The cumulative effort of building numerous CRUD UIs and their associated backend logic, all of which must be robust and secure, is often larger than it appears. Each screen is a mini-application in itself.","Prioritize the administrative features. Implement the most critical ones first (User Management, PACS Config). For less critical ones (e.g., auto-routing rules, detailed retention policy UI), consider a simpler V1 implementation (e.g., configured in a file) and defer the full UI to a later release.","If the administrative feature development falls behind schedule, work with the product owner to release V1 with only the absolute essential admin functions (user creation/deletion) and manage other settings via direct database edits or configuration files, with the full UI planned for V1.1.","By the project's midpoint, less than 50% of the planned administrative work items have been completed.","Project Manager","2025-03-20","Open"
"RISK-015","Quality","The DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE SCU functionality may have compatibility issues with different brands of PACS servers, each of which can have its own quirks and subtle deviations from the DICOM standard.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-014, WI-024","DICOM is a standard, but PACS vendor implementations vary. Issues with character set encoding, support for specific query keys, or C-MOVE negotiation are common real-world problems.","Test the SCU functionality against at least two different open-source PACS implementations (e.g., Orthanc, DCM4CHEE) during development. Use the fo-dicom logging capabilities to capture detailed DICOM negotiation logs to aid in debugging.","Provide an 'expert' configuration screen for PACS connections where advanced parameters (e.g., character set, transfer syntax preferences) can be tweaked by administrators to resolve compatibility issues with a specific PACS. Offer professional services for integrating with non-standard PACS.","The C-FIND/C-MOVE feature works against the test PACS but fails during UAT with the customer's production PACS (e.g., GE, Siemens, Agfa).","QA Lead","2025-04-05","Open"
