"RISK-R001","Resource","The project requires a combination of highly specialized skills (DICOM, pgcrypto, RabbitMQ) concentrated in a single developer (dev3). Any delay or departure of this resource would critically impact the timeline.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-US-012-02"",""TASK-US-014-02"",""TASK-US-018-01"",""TASK-US-018-02""]","4","Initiate a formal cross-training program where dev1 pairs with dev3 on RabbitMQ and pgcrypto tasks. Document all infrastructure setup and design decisions.","Identify and pre-vet a contract resource with RabbitMQ and Security expertise who can be engaged on short notice.","dev3 shows more than 100% utilization for two consecutive weeks.","25000","4 weeks to implement mitigation"
"RISK-R002","Technical","Failure to correctly implement at-rest encryption with pgcrypto (TASK-US-014-02) could lead to a data breach and severe HIPAA compliance violations, resulting in legal and financial penalties.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-US-014-02""]","2","1. Conduct a mandatory, formal security design review. 2. Implement extensive integration tests using Testcontainers. 3. Mandate peer review by a second senior developer for all related code.","Have a documented incident response plan. In case of failure, revert to application-level encryption as a temporary, less secure fallback.","A QA test or security scan detects any instance of unencrypted PHI in the database.","50000","1 week to implement mitigation"
"RISK-R003","External","DICOM C-STORE functionality is highly dependent on interoperability with third-party PACS vendors. There is a high risk of encountering protocol variations causing data transfer errors.","High","High","[""TASK-US-018-01"",""TASK-US-018-02""]","3","Develop an integration test suite using multiple DICOM toolkits (DCMTK, Orthanc) to simulate different behaviors. Implement detailed logging during DICOM association.","Ensure manual DICOM file import (drag-and-drop) is a reliable fallback mechanism.","Integration tests with a new DICOM toolkit fail repeatedly.","10000","2 weeks to resolve"
