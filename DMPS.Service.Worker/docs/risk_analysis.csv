"RISK-001","Technical","The custom GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline using DirectX and Vortice.Windows (WI-029) is exceptionally complex. There is a high probability of encountering significant challenges in development, performance tuning, and ensuring stability across different hardware, potentially delaying the entire DICOM Viewer epic (EPIC-006) and compromising the core product functionality.","4","5","20","High","WI-029, WI-030, WI-031, WI-032. The entire DICOM Viewer feature set is at risk.","Reliance on a low-level graphics API (DirectX) within a managed framework (WPF), which requires specialized skills, careful memory management, and complex interop code.","1. Prioritize a time-boxed proof-of-concept (PoC) for the rendering pipeline before committing to the full implementation. 2. Assign a developer with demonstrable experience in graphics programming or allocate dedicated training time. 3. Develop an abstraction layer over the rendering engine to simplify integration with viewer tools.","If the DirectX pipeline proves untenable within the project timeline, revert to a WPF-native rendering approach using `WriteableBitmap`. This will be less performant for very large studies but will guarantee a functional viewer for the initial release.","The rendering PoC fails to meet key performance or stability benchmarks by the end of its allocated sprint.","Lead Developer","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","Failure to correctly implement PHI protection mechanisms, such as log redaction (WI-003), at-rest encryption with pgcrypto (WI-009), or anonymization logic (WI-028), could lead to a data breach and severe HIPAA compliance violations, resulting in significant legal and financial penalties.","3","5","15","High","WI-003, WI-009, WI-028, WI-039. Any task handling PHI.","The pervasive nature of PHI throughout the application combined with the complexity of security controls creates multiple potential points of failure.","1. Conduct a mandatory, formal security design review for all components handling PHI. 2. Implement centralized, reusable services for PHI redaction and encryption. 3. Create an extensive suite of unit and integration tests specifically for these security controls. 4. Mandate peer review by a security champion for all related code changes.","Develop a documented incident response plan that includes steps for identifying the scope of a breach, notifying affected parties per the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, and immediately patching the vulnerability.","A quality assurance test or a security scan detects any instance of unencrypted or unredacted PHI in logs, database, or exported files.","Security Lead / QA Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The decoupled, asynchronous architecture using RabbitMQ for C-STORE ingestion (WI-022, WI-023) and printing (WI-034, WI-035) introduces significant complexity in ensuring message reliability, idempotency, error handling (DLQ), and traceability (correlation IDs). A flaw in this design could lead to data loss, processing failures, or a system that is difficult to debug and maintain.","4","4","16","High","WI-004, WI-005, WI-022, WI-023, WI-034, WI-035, WI-040","Distributed systems patterns (like message queuing) are inherently more complex to implement correctly than monolithic, synchronous logic.","1. Use Testcontainers to write integration tests that simulate RabbitMQ broker restarts and network partitions to verify durable queueing and consumer recovery. 2. Implement idempotent consumers from the start to safely handle message redelivery. 3. Ensure correlation IDs are generated at the client and passed through all stages of the asynchronous flow, and are included in all log messages.","For a critical processing failure, have a documented procedure for an administrator to inspect the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ), diagnose the poison message, and either manually correct and requeue it or discard it.","The number of messages in the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) is greater than zero, as shown on the System Health Dashboard (WI-021).","Lead Developer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","The system's DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE functionality (WI-024) is highly dependent on interoperability with a wide variety of third-party PACS vendors. There is a high risk of encountering protocol variations or non-standard implementations that cause connection failures or data transfer errors, limiting the system's utility in diverse clinical environments.","4","4","16","High","WI-024, WI-019","The DICOM standard, while comprehensive, has ambiguities that lead to vendor-specific interpretations and implementations.","1. Develop a comprehensive integration test suite using multiple DICOM toolkits (e.g., DCMTK, Orthanc) as test partners to simulate different PACS behaviors. 2. Expose advanced configuration options for timeouts, character sets, and transfer syntaxes to allow administrators to tune connections for problematic partners. 3. Implement extremely detailed logging during DICOM association and negotiation to aid in troubleshooting.","Provide a manual DICOM file import (drag-and-drop, WI-025) as a reliable fallback mechanism for retrieving studies when C-MOVE fails. The product documentation must be clear about this alternative.","The C-ECHO verification in the PACS configuration UI (WI-019) fails, or a C-FIND/C-MOVE operation fails with a protocol-level error.","DICOM Specialist / QA Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The secure management of encryption keys for pgcrypto (WI-009) and other secrets (DB passwords, API keys) via Windows Credential Manager (WI-020) is complex, especially for the background Windows Service which runs under a non-interactive account (Local System or a dedicated service account). Improper setup or backup can lead to irreversible data loss or a complete system lockout.","3","5","15","High","WI-009, WI-020, WI-041, WI-008","Secrets management is a specialized security discipline, and managing credentials for system services is more complex than for user-interactive applications.","1. The Deployment Guide (REQ-1-089) must contain a detailed, step-by-step procedure for provisioning the credentials for the service account. 2. The Administrator's Guide must include a critical warning and procedure for backing up the pgcrypto encryption key. 3. Implement health checks that validate the service can access its required credentials on startup.","If the primary encryption key is lost, data is unrecoverable. The only contingency is to restore from the last known good database backup (EPIC-007) and accept the data loss as defined by the RPO. This risk must be explicitly accepted by the project stakeholders.","The application fails to start with an error indicating it cannot retrieve a required secret from the Windows Credential Manager.","DevOps / Senior Developer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The data integrity guarantee of the non-destructive 'working copy' mechanism (WI-027, REQ-1-080) is critical. A logic flaw could lead to accidental modification of original DICOM files or data loss if the working copy is not managed correctly, especially with the feature to persist unsaved copies (REQ-1-081). This would violate a core non-functional requirement and clinical data integrity.","3","5","15","High","WI-027, REQ-1-081","Complex state management is required to track the original study, the working copy, and user choices (save, discard, continue), creating opportunities for race conditions or logic errors.","1. Create rigorous automated tests that perform an edit, then verify the original file's hash remains unchanged. 2. Implement a file-level read-only flag on original DICOM files as a secondary safeguard where possible. 3. The audit trail for 'Working Copy' events (created, saved, discarded) must be implemented and tested concurrently with the feature itself.","If corruption is detected, the immediate response is to restore the affected study from a file system backup. The periodic data integrity check (REQ-1-058) is the primary detective control for this scenario.","The data integrity check task logs a discrepancy where an original file's modification date or checksum has changed unexpectedly.","Lead Developer","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project requires a combination of highly specialized skills (DirectX, DICOM protocol, pgcrypto, secure systems design, MSIX packaging) that may not be available within the current team. A skill gap in any of these key areas could lead to poor implementation, security vulnerabilities, or significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-029, WI-024, WI-009, WI-020, WI-044","The technology stack is modern but also highly specialized, requiring expertise beyond that of a generalist .NET developer.","1. Conduct a formal skills assessment of the development team against the project's technical requirements. 2. Proactively schedule time for PoCs, research, and training in the most complex areas (e.g., DirectX). 3. Consider engaging a short-term external consultant for design review in critical areas like security or DICOM interoperability.","If a critical skill gap cannot be filled, de-scope or simplify the related feature for the initial release. For example, deferring the custom DirectX viewer for a simpler one or limiting initial DICOM interoperability to C-STORE only.","A key high-complexity task (e.g., WI-029) shows no progress for two consecutive weeks, indicating a developer is blocked.","Project Manager / Engineering Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The project contains numerous high-complexity, interdependent epics (Architecture, Data, Auth, DICOM). A delay in a foundational epic, such as Data Persistence (EPIC-002), will have a cascading effect, delaying all subsequent features that depend on it and jeopardizing the overall project timeline.","4","3","12","Medium","Entire project plan.","High degree of coupling between foundational architectural components and application features in the early stages of the project.","1. Map out a detailed critical path for the project, identifying key dependencies and milestones. 2. Use agile methodologies to deliver vertical slices of functionality, integrating components early and often to reveal integration issues sooner. 3. Aggressively manage the scope of foundational epics to ensure they are completed on schedule.","Identify non-essential features that can be de-scoped or moved to a subsequent release to create buffer time if the critical path is delayed. Maintain a prioritized backlog to facilitate these decisions.","A key milestone on the critical path (e.g., 'Initial Database Schema Finalized') is missed by more than one week.","Project Manager","2025-02-28","Monitoring"
"RISK-009","Technical","Implementing a custom prerequisite check within an MSIX installer (WI-044) is notoriously difficult as MSIX restricts traditional custom actions. The proposed solution of a bootstrap application may have usability or permissions issues, potentially leading to a confusing and unreliable installation experience.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-044","The chosen modern deployment technology (MSIX) has intentional limitations that conflict with the requirement for pre-installation dependency validation.","1. Research and prototype the installer check mechanism early. 2. Consider moving the check to the application's first run instead of during installation. The app would launch into a configuration wizard if it cannot connect to its dependencies.","Remove the automated check from the installer entirely. Rely on a comprehensive Deployment Guide that clearly instructs the user to install and configure PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ before running the MSIX installer, and provide a separate configuration utility.","The prototype of the bootstrap installer application fails to reliably check dependencies or write configuration in a standard user context.","Build/Deploy Engineer","2025-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-010","External","The application's licensing enforcement (WI-042) is dependent on the Odoo API. A prolonged outage of this external service beyond the 72-hour grace period would force all customers into a restricted, read-only mode, causing significant business disruption and customer dissatisfaction.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-041, WI-042","Single point of failure for a business-critical function (licensing) located in an external, third-party system.","1. Implement the 72-hour grace period as specified. 2. Implement client-side caching of the license status with a longer expiry (e.g., 7 days) to tolerate longer but intermittent outages. 3. Negotiate an SLA with the Odoo service provider that includes uptime guarantees and support response times.","Develop a secure, documented manual process for generating and distributing temporary, time-limited offline license keys to customers affected by a prolonged outage.","Internal monitoring detects that the Odoo Licensing API has been unreachable for more than 24 hours.","Project Manager / Product Owner","2025-06-30","Not Started"
