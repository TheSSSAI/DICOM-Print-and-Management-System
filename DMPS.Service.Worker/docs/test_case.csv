RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL are running.","1. Start the integrated test environment. 2. Use a DICOM SCU toolkit (e.g., DCMTK's storescu) to send a multi-file DICOM study to the service's AE Title and port. 3. Monitor the RabbitMQ queue for a new message. 4. After the message is consumed, query the PostgreSQL database for the Study Instance UID of the sent study.","The C-STORE operation completes successfully.
