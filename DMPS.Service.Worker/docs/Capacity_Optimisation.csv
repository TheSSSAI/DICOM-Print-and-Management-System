"Cross-training","Critical skills for Security, Infrastructure, and DICOM are siloed in a single developer (dev3).","Dedicate 8 hours per sprint for dev1 to pair-program with dev3 on RabbitMQ and pgcrypto implementation tasks. The goal is to create a backup resource.","Reduces key-person dependency risk by 40%. Increases team bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical infrastructure.","16","6 weeks","dev1 can independently debug and resolve a medium-complexity RabbitMQ issue by the end of the project.","Avoids potential 4-week project delay, saving over $20,000 in labor costs."
"QA Process","QA involvement is primarily for validation after development is complete.","Embed QA (qa1) earlier in the process. Have QA review acceptance criteria before sprint starts and build Testcontainers-based integration tests in parallel with development.","Reduces bug-fix cycle time by 25% by catching issues earlier. Increases quality of high-risk features like encryption and messaging.","","Immediate (process change)","Number of critical bugs found in staging is reduced by 50%.","Saves developer time on rework, valued at approximately 20-30 hours over the project."
