# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Admin Creates New User Account

## 1.2 Diagram Type

sequenceDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

To detail the end-to-end technical process for an Administrator creating a new user account. This includes UI interaction, application service orchestration, business rule validation (username uniqueness), secure password generation and hashing (BCrypt), and the critical atomic database transaction that persists both the new user record and the corresponding audit log entry.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- QA engineers
- system architects
- security auditors

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Presentation Layer (ViewModel)
- Application Service
- Password Hasher Utility
- Data Access Layer
- PostgreSQL Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Username uniqueness validation
- Secure temporary password generation
- BCrypt password hashing
- Atomic database transaction for user and audit log creation

## 3.3 Decision Points

- The primary decision is the result of `CheckUsernameExistsAsync`, which determines if the flow proceeds or returns an error.

## 3.4 Success Paths

- A new user is successfully created with a temporary password, and the event is audited.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Attempting to create a user with a username that already exists.
- Database transaction failure, leading to a rollback of both user creation and audit logging.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The atomicity of user creation and audit logging is handled via a database transaction to prevent inconsistent states.
