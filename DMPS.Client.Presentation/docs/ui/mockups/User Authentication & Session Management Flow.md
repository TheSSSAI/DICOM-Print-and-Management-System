# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- WPF Client (UI)
- Application Service (Backend Logic)
- PostgreSQL Database (for validation)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Credential Validation
- Role-Based UI Loading
- Inactivity Timer Management
- Displaying Lock Screen
- Password Validation for Unlock
- Failed Attempt Counting
- Forced Logout

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Are credentials valid?
- Is the account active?
- Is a forced password change required?
- Is user interaction detected?
- Has the inactivity timer expired?
- Is the unlock password correct?
- Have failed unlock attempts exceeded the limit?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User logs in successfully and enters an active session.
- User successfully unlocks a locked session and resumes work.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Login with invalid credentials.
- Login attempt with a disabled account.
- Unlock attempt with an incorrect password.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Forced password change workflow upon first login after a reset.
- Forced logout after 5 consecutive failed unlock attempts.
- Explicit logout from either the main application or the lock screen.
