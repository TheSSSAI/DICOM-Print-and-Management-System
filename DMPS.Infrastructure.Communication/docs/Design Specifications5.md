These handle 'IConnectionFactory', 'IConnection', 'IModel' directly.\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Settings/'**: Strongly-typed configuration classes (e.g., 'RabbitMQSettings.cs' for host, port, credentials, vhost, retry policies).\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Serializers/'**: Classes for message serialization/deserialization (e.g., 'JsonMessageSerializer.cs', 'BinaryMessageSerializer.cs').\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Messages/'**: DTOs or models representing the actual messages exchanged via RabbitMQ (both inbound and outbound).\n    *   '/RabbitMQ/Extensions/'**: 'ServiceCollection' extension methods for easily registering RabbitMQ services ('RabbitMQServiceCollectionExtensions.cs').\n*   **'/Pipes/'**: Contains all System.IO.Pipes-specific infrastructure components.\n    *   '/Pipes/Interfaces/'**: Defines interfaces for pipe servers and clients (e.g., 'INamedPipeServer', 'INamedPipeClient').\n    *   '/Pipes/Implementations/'**: Concrete implementations for named pipe servers and clients (e.g., 'NamedPipeServer.cs', 'NamedPipeClient.cs'). Handles 'NamedPipeServerStream', 'NamedPipeClientStream'.\n    *   '/Pipes/Settings/'**: Strongly-typed configuration classes (e.g., 'PipeSettings.cs' for pipe name, direction, buffer size, security).\n    *   '/Pipes/DataContracts/'**: DTOs or models representing data exchanged over pipes.\n    *   '/Pipes/Extensions/'**: 'ServiceCollection' extension methods for registering pipe services ('PipeServiceCollectionExtensions.cs').\n*   **'/Resilience/'**: Contains generic or technology-specific resilience policies (e.g., 'PollyRetryPolicy.cs' or a specific 'RabbitMQRetryPolicy.cs') for connection re-establishment or message retries, using 'Polly' for a robust approach.\n*   **'/Common/'**: Utility classes or base components shared across different infrastructure concerns.\n\nCritical RabbitMQ.Client v6.8.1, System.IO.Pipes-optimized interfaces with other components:\n*   **'IMessageProducer' (from /RabbitMQ/Interfaces/)**: Exposes methods like 'PublishAsync(string routingKey, T message)' to the Application layer, abstracting RabbitMQ-specific 'IModel.BasicPublish' details and message serialization.\n*   **'IMessageConsumer' (from /RabbitMQ/Interfaces/)**: Defines methods like 'StartConsuming(Func<T, Task> messageHandler)' for the Application layer to register callbacks for incoming messages, abstracting 'EventingBasicConsumer' and message deserialization.\n*   **'INamedPipeServer' (from /Pipes/Interfaces/)**: Offers methods like 'StartAsync()' and 'SendMessageAsync(string message)' for external components to initiate listening and send data over a named pipe, abstracting 'NamedPipeServerStream' complexities.\n\nFor this Infrastructure repository type with RabbitMQ.Client v6.8.1, System.IO.Pipes, the JSON structure should particularly emphasize:\n-   **'TechnologySpecificFolders'**: Grouping files under '/RabbitMQ/' and '/Pipes/' subdirectories to clearly delineate the specific technology being used and its related components, optimizing for modularity and maintainability.\n-   **'SettingsAndConfiguration'**: Dedicated 'Settings' folders within each technology's module (e.g., '/RabbitMQ/Settings/RabbitMQSettings.cs') to centralize technology-specific configuration, aligning with 'Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration' patterns for externalized and manageable settings.\n-   **'AsynchronousProgrammingModels'**: Structuring all service methods to return 'Task' or 'ValueTask', enforcing the modern C# asynchronous programming model ('async/await') for all I/O bound operations, which is critical for message brokers and stream-based communication.\n-   **'DependencyInjectionExtensions'**: Providing 'ServiceCollection' extension methods ('RabbitMQServiceCollectionExtensions.cs', 'PipeServiceCollectionExtensions.cs') at the root of each technology's module or a common 'Extensions' folder, enabling straightforward registration of all infrastructure services in the host application's DI container.\n
