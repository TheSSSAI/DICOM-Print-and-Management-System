"RISK-001","Technical","The GPU-accelerated DICOM viewer, using DirectX via the Vortice.Windows wrapper, introduces significant technical complexity and risk. Potential issues include performance bottlenecks with large multi-frame studies, memory leaks from unmanaged GPU resources, and steep learning curves, leading to major schedule delays.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-005 (DICOM Viewer & Image Manipulation), especially WI-022 (GPU-Accelerated Rendering) and WI-023 (Progressive Loading). Delays here will block all user-facing clinical functionality.","Reliance on a highly specialized, low-level graphics API (DirectX) within a managed code environment for a core, performance-critical feature.","1. Develop a technical spike/Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for the rendering pipeline within the first sprint to validate performance and identify challenges early. 2. Enforce rigorous code reviews and pair programming for all DirectX-related code. 3. Utilize GPU performance profiling tools throughout the development cycle.","If the DirectX approach proves unfeasible, fall back to a simpler, CPU-based rendering pipeline using WPF's built-in `WriteableBitmap`. This will have lower performance but ensures a functional viewer, meeting MVP requirements.","The rendering PoC fails to achieve interactive frame rates (>30 FPS) for a 500-slice CT study on target hardware. Or, significant memory leaks are detected during initial testing.","Lead Developer","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure to achieve and maintain full HIPAA compliance across the system. Risks include incomplete PHI redaction in logs, misconfiguration of data-at-rest encryption (pgcrypto), insecure credential storage, or bypassable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), leading to severe legal, financial, and reputational damage.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-008 (Security & Compliance), WI-004 (Logging), WI-043 (Encryption), WI-014 (RBAC). This is a cross-cutting concern affecting the entire application.","The complexity and strictness of HIPAA regulations combined with the multiple potential points of PHI leakage (logs, database, UI, network).","1. Create a detailed HIPAA compliance checklist mapping every technical feature to specific regulatory requirements. 2. Conduct mandatory security code reviews for all features handling PHI. 3. Implement automated tests to verify PHI redaction in logs. 4. Engage a third-party security consultant for a compliance audit before release.","If a compliance gap is discovered late in the cycle, all other development will be halted to prioritize the fix. The release will be postponed until the gap is verifiably closed. A detailed report will be prepared for stakeholders.","An automated test for PHI redaction fails. A security code review identifies a potential PHI leakage vector. The audit trail fails to log a critical security event.","Security Lead","2025-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","High key-person dependency on a developer with the specialized skills for DirectX/Vortice.Windows programming. The loss of this individual could halt progress on the core DICOM viewer, causing catastrophic schedule delays and potentially compromising the quality of this critical component.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-005 (DICOM Viewer & Image Manipulation), particularly WS-007 (Image Rendering). This risk jeopardizes the entire clinical value proposition of the application.","The project's technology stack includes a niche, highly complex component (GPU rendering) that is not a common skill among typical .NET application developers.","1. Mandate pair programming for all work on the rendering engine. 2. Require comprehensive documentation and architectural diagrams for the rendering pipeline. 3. Actively cross-train a second developer on the rendering components from the project start.","Identify and pre-vet a list of external contractors or consulting firms with proven expertise in .NET and DirectX integration. Establish a master service agreement to enable rapid engagement if needed.","The primary rendering developer becomes unavailable for more than 3 consecutive workdays without a designated, trained backup developer being available to take over.","Development Manager","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","DICOM interoperability issues with third-party PACS and modalities. Despite `fo-dicom`'s robustness, different vendor implementations of the DICOM standard can lead to failures in C-STORE, C-FIND, or C-MOVE operations, blocking deployment and causing significant rework.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-003 (C-STORE SCP), EPIC-004 (Query/Retrieve), especially WI-015, WI-018, and WI-019. This directly impacts the system's ability to integrate into a clinical environment.","Lack of strict adherence to the DICOM standard by some medical device and software vendors, leading to implementation-specific quirks.","1. Establish a local test lab with multiple open-source PACS (e.g., Orthanc, dcm4che) and a diverse library of sample DICOM files from public datasets. 2. Implement detailed logging for all DICOM network transactions to aid in debugging. 3. Adhere strictly to the DICOM standard in all developed code.","Allocate a specific buffer in the project schedule (e.g., a 2-week ""Integration Sprint"") for addressing customer-specific interoperability issues discovered during user acceptance testing (UAT) or deployment.","Automated integration tests fail against any of the local test PACS servers. The system fails to process a new type of DICOM study from a sample dataset.","DICOM Specialist","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Potential for catastrophic data loss due to a bug in the automated data retention/auto-purge feature. An error in the deletion logic could permanently erase studies that should have been retained, violating data governance policies and causing irreversible loss of clinical data.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-039 (Implement Configurable Data Retention Policy). This is a high-impact, low-probability risk that requires careful handling.","Automating a permanent, destructive action on a production database and file system without sufficient safeguards.","1. Implement the feature with a mandatory ""dry run"" mode that only logs what it would delete. 2. Initially implement a two-stage deletion: first, a soft delete (marking records as 'to-be-purged'), followed by a hard delete after a configurable grace period (e.g., 30 days). 3. The purge action must be logged in extreme detail in the audit trail.","The primary contingency is the database backup and restore procedure. This procedure must be documented and regularly tested. If a wrongful purge occurs, the system must be taken offline for restoration from the last valid backup.","A scheduled ""dry run"" of the purge job reports an unexpectedly high number of studies to be deleted, triggering an alert for manual review before the hard delete is approved.","Backend Lead","2025-09-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Deployment failures at customer sites due to complex environmental prerequisites (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, firewall rules). The installer's prerequisite check might fail, or post-install configuration issues could prevent the system from functioning, leading to a poor customer experience and high support costs.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-009 (Deployment & Operations), specifically WI-044 (MSIX Installer) and WI-045 (Installer Prerequisite Check).","The system architecture has strong dependencies on external services that are not bundled with the application, shifting the configuration burden to the deploying organization.","1. Develop a standalone ""Environment Pre-flight Check"" utility that customers can run before installation to validate all prerequisites. 2. Create an exhaustive Deployment Guide with detailed, step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting sections for common errors. 3. Containerize the entire application stack using Docker for internal testing to ensure all dependencies are well-understood.","Have a well-defined remote support plan, allowing the support team to securely access the customer's environment to assist with troubleshooting installation and configuration issues.","Internal test deployments on clean virtual machines fail more than 10% of the time due to environmental setup issues.","Release Manager","2025-10-31","Not Started"
"RISK-007","External","An extended outage or breaking API change of the external Odoo licensing API could force the application into a restricted, read-only mode for all customers, even after the 72-hour grace period, crippling essential functionality like printing and receiving new studies.","2","4","8","Medium","License validation workflow (REQ-1-073). Affects the entire application's operational mode.","Dependency on a single, external, third-party service for a critical business function (licensing).","1. Implement the 72-hour grace period robustly. 2. Implement a circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff for all API calls to prevent system degradation during an outage. 3. The System Health Dashboard must prominently display the status of the Odoo API connection.","Develop a secure, documented, out-of-band process for administrators to manually apply a temporary, time-limited offline license key to bypass the API check during a confirmed prolonged outage of the Odoo service.","The System Health Dashboard reports the Odoo API connection as 'Failed' for more than one hour, triggering an alert to the support team.","Product Owner","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Technical","Failure to maintain transactional consistency between database records and file system operations during study ingestion. An error after a file is moved but before the database commit could result in orphaned files, or vice-versa, leading to data integrity issues.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-017 (Study Persistence Consumer). This is a core data ingestion task where integrity is paramount.","Lack of native distributed transaction support between a relational database (PostgreSQL) and a standard file system.","1. Design the consumer logic to be idempotent (re-processing the same message doesn't cause duplicates). 2. Always perform the file system operation first, writing to a final destination, and make the database commit the final step. If the DB commit fails, a cleanup job can find and remove the orphaned file. 3. Implement the scheduled data integrity check (WI-058) to detect and report any discrepancies.","Create a documented procedure for an administrator to use the report from the data integrity check to manually reconcile inconsistencies (e.g., delete orphaned files, re-ingest studies for orphaned records).","The periodic data integrity check job logs a report containing one or more discrepancies between the database and the file system.","Backend Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
