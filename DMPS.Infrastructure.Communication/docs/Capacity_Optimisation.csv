"Cross-training","Critical skill dependency on Senior Graphics Developer, creating a single point of failure (RISK-003).","Formalize a cross-training plan: Allocate 10 hours/sprint of the Fullstack Developer's capacity to pair program on DirectX tasks with the Graphics Developer for the first 4 sprints.","Reduces key-person dependency risk by 50%. Creates a backup resource capable of maintaining and extending the viewer.","40","8 weeks","Fullstack developer can independently resolve a medium-complexity bug in the rendering pipeline by end of Sprint 4.","Mitigates risk of project delay valued at over $100,000 for a fraction of the cost."
"Resource Augmentation","The Fullstack Developer is a critical backup for multiple roles and also owns all DevOps tasks, creating a potential bottleneck.","Engage a part-time (20 hrs/week) DevOps contractor for Sprints 5-7 to own the MSIX installer, deployment scripts, and documentation.","Frees up 100% of the Fullstack Developer's capacity for core development and critical cross-training on the DICOM viewer.","120","6 weeks","A production-ready MSIX installer is delivered without impacting the Fullstack Developer's sprint goals.","Improves project success probability by de-risking both the viewer and deployment simultaneously."
