"Cross-training","Critical knowledge in DirectX and DICOM/ETL is siloed in single individuals.","Implement a formal knowledge transfer plan. Mandate 10 hours per sprint of pair programming on critical tasks (`senior.frontend` with `frontend.dev`, `senior.backend` with `backend.dev`).","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40%. Increases team bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical skills.","20","12 weeks","Secondary developers are able to independently resolve low-complexity bugs in specialized areas.","Mitigates risk of project delays worth >$100,000 for a cost of ~2.5% of team capacity."
"Contractor Augmentation","The Senior Backend Developer is a bottleneck for Sprints 5 and 6 due to the concurrent complexity of GSPS and Migration.","Hire a short-term (4-6 week) contractor with strong ETL and C# skills to own the Data Migration Utility (EPIC-008).","Frees up the Senior Backend Developer to focus exclusively on the critical DICOM GSPS implementation, reducing risk for both epics and potentially accelerating the timeline.","30000","6 weeks","Both GSPS and Migration epics are delivered on time without compromising quality.","Prevents a likely 2-3 week project slip, saving more in delay costs than the contractor's fee."
