"RISK-R001","Technical","The GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline using DirectX and Vortice.Windows represents a critical point of technical complexity. Failure to implement this performantly and stably could render the core DICOM viewer unusable.","High","Critical","[""TASK-033"",""TASK-034"",""TASK-036"",""TASK-038""]","4","Dedicate a senior developer with graphics experience. Conduct an early-phase technical spike (TASK-033) to validate the rendering approach and establish a stable foundation.","Develop a simpler, CPU-based software rendering path as a fallback to ensure basic functionality.","Failure to achieve stable 60 FPS on target hardware by the end of TASK-033.","25000","4 weeks to implement contingency"
"RISK-R002","External","The system's dependency on pre-installed PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ creates a deployment risk. Misconfiguration by customer IT will cause installation or runtime failure.","High","Critical","[""TASK-020"",""TASK-021"",""TASK-023""]","1","Create a standalone prerequisite validation utility for customers. Provide a comprehensive deployment guide with checklists and troubleshooting steps.","Develop PowerShell scripts to automate the configuration of dependencies for customer IT.","The MSIX prerequisite check fails during internal testing against a deliberately misconfigured environment.","5000","2 weeks to develop scripts"
"RISK-R006","Resource","The project relies on a combination of highly specialized technologies (DirectX, fo-dicom, RabbitMQ). There is a significant risk of key person dependency on the senior developer.","Medium","High","[""TASK-013"",""TASK-026"",""TASK-033"",""TASK-034""]","6","Enforce pair programming for the most complex modules (DirectX viewer, DICOM SCP). Maintain high-quality documentation. Conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions.","Identify and pre-vet external contractors with niche skills who can be brought in on short notice.","A skills matrix review shows only one developer proficient in a critical technology.","30000","4 weeks to onboard contractor"
