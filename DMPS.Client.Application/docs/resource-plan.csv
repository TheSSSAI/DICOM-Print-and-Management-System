TASK-102,"Implement Email Service using MailKit",Backend Development,Integration,Medium,8.3,Mid,1,TASK-097,No,"A wrapper around the MailKit library to provide a simple, testable service for sending emails.","Use the obsolete System.Net.Mail library, which is not recommended."
TASK-103,"Develop Email Composition Dialog and ViewModel",Frontend Development,Email,High,12,Mid,1,"TASK-098,TASK-092,TASK-099",No,"UI for sending emails, including the critical PHI security warning dialog that requires explicit user confirmation.","Allow sending emails without a warning, which is a major compliance risk."
TASK-104,"Create and Configure MSIX Packaging Project",DevOps,"",Medium,8.3,Mid,1,TASK-001,Yes,"Sets up the modern deployment package for the entire application.","Deploy by xcopying the build output folder, which is unprofessional and provides no installer."
TASK-105,"Implement Windows Service Installation via Manifest",DevOps,"",High,10,Senior,1,TASK-100,Yes,"Complex configuration within the MSIX manifest to get the background service to register and start correctly.","Require a separate installer or manual PowerShell script to install the service, defeating the purpose of a single package."
TASK-106,"Set up Build Pipeline for Code Signing",DevOps,Security,High,12,Senior,1,TASK-100,Yes,"A critical deployment step. An unsigned package will not install on standard user machines. Requires secure management of the signing certificate.","Do not sign the package, requiring all users to enable developer mode or use a self-signed certificate, which is not viable for production."

Alters the fundamental startup flow of the application. Tied to RISK-004.","Have the application fail on first run with an error, requiring manual config file creation, which is a terrible user experience."
TASK-108,"Implement Prerequisite Connection Testers",Backend Development,Deployment,High,12,Mid,1,"",Yes,"The core logic for the first-run wizard, which validates the environment before allowing the application to proceed. Tied to RISK-004.","Assume the configuration is correct, which would lead to runtime errors later."
