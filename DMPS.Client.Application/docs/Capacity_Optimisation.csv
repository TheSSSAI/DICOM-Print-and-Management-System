"Cross-training","Critical key-person dependency on Senior Dev for DirectX skills.","Mandate pair programming between Senior and Mid developer for all viewer-related tasks in Sprint 4 (TASK-034, TASK-036, TASK-038).","Reduces key-person risk by 50%. Increases code quality and knowledge retention. Creates a backup resource.","20","2 weeks","Mid developer can independently resolve a medium-complexity bug in the rendering pipeline.","Avoids potential 6-week project delay, saving over $40,000 in labor costs."
"QA Capacity","QA Engineer is over-allocated in Sprints 1 and 3, creating a bottleneck for validation.","Shift the responsibility of unit and basic integration testing entirely to the developers. QA focuses on complex integration, E2E, and manual validation.","Frees up 30% of QA capacity to focus on high-value testing. Improves overall code quality via developer-led testing.","8","Ongoing","Achieve >80% unit test code coverage for all new code written by developers.","Reduces the QA bottleneck, preventing a 1-week slip in the schedule worth ~$7,500."
