"RISK-001","Technical","The GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline using DirectX and Vortice.Windows (WI-028) represents a critical point of technical complexity. Failure to implement this performantly and stably could render the core DICOM viewer unusable, severely impacting the application's primary function and user acceptance.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-003, WS-010 (DICOM Viewer and Image Manipulation), WI-028, WI-029, WI-030, WI-031","Reliance on a low-level graphics API (DirectX) within a managed framework (WPF), which requires specialized, non-trivial skills in memory management, GPU resource handling, and interop programming.","Dedicate a senior developer with proven graphics programming experience to this task. Conduct an early-phase technical spike (time-boxed prototype) to validate the rendering approach, identify performance bottlenecks, and establish a stable foundation before building viewer tools on top.","Develop a simpler, CPU-based software rendering path as a fallback. While slower, it would ensure basic image viewing functionality if GPU acceleration proves too unstable or incompatible with certain hardware. This path would be disabled by default.","Failure to achieve a stable 60 FPS during interactive window/level operations on a 512x512 image on target hardware by the end of the initial technical spike.","Lead Developer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The system's dependency on pre-installed and configured instances of PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ (REQ-1-002) creates a significant deployment risk. Misconfiguration by the customer's IT department (e.g., incorrect permissions, firewall blocks, disabled pgcrypto extension) will cause installation failure (WI-007) or runtime errors, halting the entire application.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-001, WS-003 (Deployment and Installation), WI-007, All data persistence and asynchronous tasks.","The architectural decision to not bundle dependencies shifts the responsibility of complex infrastructure setup to the end-user, who may lack the specific expertise required.","Create a standalone prerequisite validation utility that the customer can run before the main installation. This tool will provide detailed, actionable feedback on connectivity, permissions, and required extensions. Augment this with a comprehensive, step-by-step deployment guide with clear checklists and troubleshooting steps (REQ-1-089).","If deployment failures are frequent, develop a set of PowerShell scripts that can be provided to customer IT to automate the configuration of PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ according to the application's specific needs.","The MSIX installer's prerequisite check fails during internal testing against a deliberately misconfigured environment.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","Failure to achieve seamless interoperability with a customer's specific brand of PACS for C-FIND and C-MOVE operations (WI-023, WI-024). DICOM standard implementations vary, and issues with association negotiation or query syntax can block a critical data import workflow.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-003, WS-008 (DICOM Network Services), WI-023, WI-024","Inherent ambiguity and vendor-specific interpretations of the DICOM standard, especially in query models and association parameters.","Obtain access to a test environment or a sandboxed instance of the primary target PACS vendor early in the development cycle. Implement extensive and detailed logging of all DICOM network traffic, particularly association negotiation, to simplify debugging.","If direct C-MOVE fails, implement a fallback mechanism where the application queries the PACS, then initiates a C-GET request or uses WADO-RS if available. This provides an alternative retrieval method. Allocate budget for on-site integration support.","C-ECHO verification or initial C-FIND queries fail against the target test PACS for more than three consecutive days during development.","Integration Specialist","2025-05-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","There is a risk of data integrity loss between the database and the file system (WI-027). A failure during the ingestion process after the database transaction commits but before the DICOM file is moved to permanent storage could result in orphaned database records pointing to non-existent files.","3","5","15","High","WI-026, WI-027, REQ-1-058","The file system move and the database commit are not part of a single atomic distributed transaction, creating a small window for failure between the two operations.","Implement a two-phase commit pattern. First, move the file to a 'pending' permanent location. Second, commit the database transaction with the 'pending' path. Third, upon successful commit, rename the file to its final name. This significantly narrows the failure window. The scheduled data integrity check (REQ-1-058) acts as a detective control.","The scheduled data integrity check (REQ-1-058) will identify discrepancies. Create an admin-facing tool or script to either re-ingest the file from a quarantine location or safely purge the orphaned database record, based on the findings.","The periodic data integrity check job logs more than 0.1% of studies as having missing files over a 24-hour period.","Backend Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","A security vulnerability in the implementation of PHI encryption, access control (RBAC), or data anonymization could lead to a HIPAA breach, resulting in severe legal, financial, and reputational damage. The complexity of requirements like pgcrypto encryption (REQ-1-083) and audit trails (REQ-1-047) increases the likelihood of subtle but critical implementation errors.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-002, WS-006 (RBAC), REQ-1-012, REQ-1-083","The inherent complexity of security features and the stringent, unforgiving nature of HIPAA compliance requirements.","Mandate peer reviews by a security-focused developer for all code related to authentication, authorization, encryption, and logging. Commission a third-party security audit and penetration test focused on HIPAA compliance before the first production release. Use established security libraries and patterns rigorously.","Develop a documented incident response plan that includes steps for identifying the scope of a breach, notifying affected parties as required by law, and remediating the vulnerability. Ensure the audit trail provides sufficient detail for forensic analysis.","The automated dependency vulnerability scan (REQ-1-085) identifies a high or critical severity vulnerability in a library handling security or data.","Security Champion","2025-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project relies on a combination of highly specialized and disparate technologies (DirectX, fo-dicom, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL admin). There is a significant risk of key person dependency, where the loss of a single team member with unique expertise could severely delay the project.","3","4","12","Medium","All major epics (EPIC-001, EPIC-002, EPIC-003)","The chosen technology stack is broad and deep, making it unlikely that multiple team members have mastery across all areas.","Enforce a policy of pair programming for the most complex modules (especially the DirectX viewer and DICOM SCP service). Maintain high-quality, up-to-date documentation for all architectural components. Conduct regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions where specialists train other team members on their respective domains.","Identify and pre-vet external contractors or consultants with the required niche skills who can be brought in on short notice if a key team member becomes unavailable.","A review of the skills matrix shows only one developer proficient in a critical technology area (e.g., Vortice.Windows).","Project Manager","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","The implementation of a custom MSIX installer with prerequisite checks (WI-007) and Windows Service registration (WI-008) is complex and may take significantly longer than estimated. Delays in producing a stable installer will block all testing cycles and delay project delivery.","4","3","12","Medium","EPIC-001, WS-003 (Deployment and Installation)","The limitations and complexities of the MSIX packaging framework for running custom code and displaying custom UI during installation.","Develop the installer iteratively. Create a basic, functional installer early in the project, even before all features are complete. Add the prerequisite checks and service configurations in subsequent sprints. This de-risks the process and provides a deployable artifact for QA sooner.","If the MSIX custom checks prove unworkable, revert to a simpler MSIX package and provide the prerequisite validation tool (from RISK-002 mitigation) as a separate, mandatory pre-flight check for administrators to run manually before installation.","The first iteration of the installer with prerequisite checks is not successfully and repeatedly deployable two sprints after work on it has begun.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-20","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Operational","Failed messages in RabbitMQ will be routed to the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) but may go unnoticed (REQ-1-006). If the DLQ is not actively monitored, critical operations like database writes or print jobs could fail silently, leading to data loss or unfulfilled user requests.","3","4","12","Medium","All asynchronous operations (printing, C-STORE ingestion, PDF generation).","A Dead-Letter Queue is a passive mechanism; it requires an active monitoring and alerting component to be effective.","Implement the critical error alerting mechanism (REQ-1-092) to send an email to a configured administrator address whenever the message count in the DLQ is greater than zero. The System Health Dashboard (REQ-1-091) must prominently display the DLQ message count with a red/warning indicator.","Develop a small utility or script for administrators to inspect, requeue, or purge messages from the DLQ. This provides a manual intervention tool for recovery.","The System Health Dashboard shows a DLQ message count greater than zero.","Backend Lead","2025-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Quality","The non-functional performance targets for study loading (<3s for 500MB) and UI responsiveness (<500ms) are aggressive. Failure to meet these targets will result in a poor user experience, user frustration, and potential rejection of the system in a clinical setting.","3","3","9","Medium","REQ-1-077, WI-029, WI-030","Optimizing for performance often conflicts with feature development speed, and can be overlooked until late in the project. The combination of large data volumes and complex rendering makes meeting targets challenging.","Integrate performance profiling (e.g., using dotTrace or Visual Studio's built-in tools) into the development workflow from the beginning. Define and automate a set of performance tests that run nightly against a baseline dataset, including a 500MB study. This will catch regressions early.","If targets are not met, an optimization-focused sprint will be scheduled. This could involve refactoring rendering code, optimizing database queries with `AsNoTracking()` for read operations, or introducing a more aggressive caching layer for metadata.","The automated nightly performance test shows a regression of more than 15% in study load time or UI interaction time.","QA Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Timeline","The project includes a large number of cross-cutting concerns like comprehensive auditing, security hardening, and detailed monitoring. These requirements can be systematically underestimated and under-resourced, leading to significant work late in the project cycle and delaying release.","3","4","12","Medium","REQ-1-047, REQ-1-080, REQ-1-091, REQ-1-090","Cross-cutting concerns are not discrete features and are often harder to estimate than user-facing stories. Their implementation touches many parts of the codebase.","For every new feature user story, explicitly include sub-tasks for implementing required auditing, security checks, and logging. Use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) techniques or middleware patterns where possible to apply these concerns centrally, reducing boilerplate code and risk of omission.","If these concerns are impacting velocity, dedicate a full sprint to building out and hardening the core frameworks for auditing and security, creating a solid foundation that feature developers can then easily consume.","Code reviews consistently find that new feature submissions are missing required audit log entries or security checks.","Lead Architect","2025-03-31","Not Started"
