"TEST-DICOM-001","DICOM Ingestion","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end DICOM C-STORE ingestion pipeline, ensuring a received study is queued, persisted to the database, and stored on the file system.","Critical - Failure means the system cannot receive clinical data, its primary function.","High","Windows Service is running. PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ Testcontainers are running. Configured storage path is writable.","1. Use a fo-dicom SCU client to send a multi-file DICOM study to the service's SCP port. 2. Verify the SCU client receives a DICOM success response (0x0000). 3. Connect to the RabbitMQ container and verify a message for the study exists in the 'dicom-ingest' queue. 4. Wait for the consumer to process the message. 5. Verify the message is removed from the queue. 6. Query the PostgreSQL container and verify records for Patient, Study, Series, and Images were created. 7. Check the file system to verify DICOM files exist in the correct hierarchical path.","The DICOM study is successfully received, and all corresponding database records and file system artifacts are created correctly and consistently.","A sample multi-file DICOM study.","xUnit, Testcontainers (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ), fo-dicom","12","24","8","Windows Service, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, fo-dicom library","CI environment with Docker support.","100% data integrity between received study, database records, and stored files.
