"RISK-001","Technical","Failure to correctly implement all HIPAA-mandated security controls (e.g., PHI redaction in logs, encryption at rest via pgcrypto, comprehensive audit trails, RBAC) could lead to a compliance breach, resulting in severe legal and financial penalties.","4","5","20","High","WI-008 (PHI Masking), WI-011 (PHI Encryption), WS-005 (Database Security), EPIC-002 (User Auth/Authz)","The inherent complexity of HIPAA regulations and the requirement for flawless implementation across multiple system components (logging, database, application logic). An oversight in any single area compromises the entire system's compliance posture.","1. Engage a third-party HIPAA compliance consultant for architectural review and validation. 2. Implement a dedicated, heavily unit-tested library for PHI redaction. 3. Automate security vulnerability scans (OWASP) in the CI pipeline. 4. Conduct mandatory developer training on secure coding for healthcare applications.","Develop a formal Incident Response Plan, as required by HIPAA, to manage containment, notification, and remediation in the event of a data breach. Secure cyber liability insurance to mitigate financial impact.","Findings from a security audit or penetration test. A validated bug report from QA indicating PHI leakage. An alert from a log analysis tool detecting unredacted PHI patterns.","Lead Architect","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","Delays in completing foundational work items in EPIC-001 (Core Architecture) and EPIC-002 (Security) will cause a cascading delay across the entire project, as nearly all functional user stories are dependent on these core components.","4","4","16","High","All work streams following WS-001 through WS-006.","High technical complexity and tight coupling of foundational epics with the rest of the feature set. Underestimation of the effort required for robust IPC, DI, and authentication frameworks.","1. Prioritize and allocate primary development resources to EPIC-001 and EPIC-002. 2. Use feature flags and mocked services to allow parallel UI development against incomplete backend infrastructure. 3. Conduct weekly dependency and critical path reviews.","If foundational epics are delayed by more than one sprint, immediately conduct a re-planning session with the Product Owner to define a reduced-scope Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to meet deadlines.","Any core work item (e.g., WI-002, WI-014) is not completed within its estimated sprint. The number of open tasks in core epics does not decrease week-over-week.","Project Manager","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The system fails to meet the stringent performance targets for DICOM study loading (<3s for 500MB) and C-STORE SCP throughput (10 concurrent associations), leading to poor user adoption and inability to function in a high-volume clinical environment.","4","4","16","High","DICOM Viewer implementation (rendering pipeline), C-STORE SCP implementation (decoupled architecture).","The complexity of high-performance DICOM rendering (requiring GPU acceleration via Vortice.Windows) and asynchronous, high-throughput network data ingestion. Potential bottlenecks in file I/O, database writes, or message queueing.","1. Develop proof-of-concept prototypes for the DICOM viewer rendering pipeline and the C-STORE ingestion mechanism early in the project. 2. Establish a dedicated performance testing environment with realistic data volumes. 3. Integrate automated performance tests into the CI pipeline.","Allocate specific 'optimization sprints' in the project plan. If targets are still not met, consult with stakeholders to potentially relax non-critical performance requirements or invest in higher-spec hardware.","Automated performance tests show a regression or fail to meet a defined threshold. Feedback from early user demos indicates the application feels sluggish.","Lead Developer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","Customer-side misconfiguration of prerequisites (PostgreSQL 16, RabbitMQ, pgcrypto extension, network ports) prevents successful installation or runtime operation, leading to deployment failures and a high volume of support calls.","4","4","16","High","MSIX installer creation, Deployment Guide documentation.","The system's reliance on external, customer-managed dependencies. The variety of customer IT environments makes it difficult to anticipate all potential configuration issues.","1. Create a comprehensive, heavily tested Deployment Guide with checklists and a troubleshooting section. 2. Develop a standalone 'Prerequisite Checker' utility that customers can run to validate their environment before installation. 3. Enhance the MSIX installer's checks to provide highly descriptive error messages.","Prepare detailed knowledge base articles and support scripts for diagnosing common environmental issues. Ensure the support team is trained on the system's dependencies.","High failure rate during internal test deployments. Early feedback from beta testers indicates installation difficulties.","DevOps Engineer","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","The standalone data migration utility fails to correctly migrate data from the legacy system, resulting in data loss, corruption, or extended downtime during the production cutover. This could severely impact clinical operations.","3","5","15","High","REQ-1-093 (Data Migration Utility).","Underestimation of the complexity of legacy data schemas, data cleanliness issues in the source system, and insufficient validation of the migrated data.","1. Treat the migration utility as a first-class project with its own requirements and testing phases. 2. Implement robust ETLV (Extract, Transform, Load, Validate) with detailed logging and dry-run capabilities. 3. Perform multiple full-scale test migrations in a staging environment before the production cutover.","Develop and test a comprehensive rollback plan to revert to the legacy system if post-migration validation fails. Plan for a phased migration of non-critical data if a big-bang approach is too risky.","Validation reports from dry runs show significant record count mismatches or data transformation errors. The time taken for a full migration exceeds the planned downtime window.","Data Migration Specialist","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The broad and specialized technology stack (.NET 8, WPF, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Vortice.Windows) creates a key-person dependency or reveals skill gaps within the team, leading to development bottlenecks and lower quality implementation in complex areas.","3","4","12","Medium","All work items, especially those involving complex technologies like WI-002 (RabbitMQ) or GPU-accelerated rendering.","The project requires expertise across multiple disparate domains (desktop UI, message-oriented middleware, database administration, low-level graphics programming) which may not be present in all team members.","1. Conduct a team skills matrix assessment early in the project. 2. Implement a mandatory peer code review process for all changes, especially in critical components. 3. Encourage pair programming on complex tasks to share knowledge. 4. Budget for external training or expert consultation if significant skill gaps are identified.","If a key person is lost, re-prioritize the backlog to delay features dependent on their unique skills and bring in a contractor or consultant to backfill the knowledge gap.","A single developer is consistently assigned all tasks related to a specific technology. Code reviews for a component repeatedly show a lack of understanding from other team members.","Development Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","Incorrect configuration of RabbitMQ durability, message persistence, or dead-lettering mechanisms could lead to loss of critical data (e.g., study metadata, print jobs) during a broker restart or unhandled processing error.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-003 (Configure Queues for Durability)","A simple configuration oversight, such as forgetting to declare a queue as 'durable' or publish a message with the 'persistent' flag, can have catastrophic consequences for data integrity.","1. Create a specific integration test suite that simulates a RabbitMQ broker restart and verifies message recovery. 2. Implement another integration test that forces a message processing failure and confirms the message is routed to the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). 3. Codify all queue and exchange declarations in a centralized, reviewed module.","Develop a documented procedure for an administrator to inspect the DLQ and manually re-queue or archive messages. The System Health Dashboard must monitor the DLQ count.","A message is processed successfully but is not present after a planned broker restart during testing. A known poison message is not routed to the DLQ.","Lead Developer","2025-03-15","In Progress"
"RISK-008","External","The external Odoo Licensing API becomes unavailable or its contract changes, causing the application to enter a restricted read-only mode after the 72-hour grace period, disrupting clinical workflows for all users.","3","3","9","Medium","REQ-1-073 (License Validation Workflow)","Dependency on an external network service outside the project team's control for a business-critical function.","1. Implement robust retry logic with exponential backoff for all API calls. 2. Ensure the 72-hour grace period logic is thoroughly tested, including how its state is persisted across application restarts. 3. Provide a clear, non-alarming UI notification to users when the application enters the grace period.","Establish an SLA with the Odoo API provider. Develop a manual override mechanism (e.g., an admin-entered emergency license key) that can be provided by support to temporarily bypass the API check in a prolonged outage.","The application logs show repeated failed attempts to connect to the licensing API. An increase in support tickets related to the application being in read-only mode.","Product Owner","2025-05-15","Not Started"
