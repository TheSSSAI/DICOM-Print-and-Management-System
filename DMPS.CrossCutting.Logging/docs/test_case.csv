Application is installed and running.","1. Launch application. 2. Enter 'Technician' credentials and login. 3. Assert 'Administration' UI element is not visible. 4. Logout. 5. Enter 'Administrator' credentials and login. 6.

"TEST-INT-001","Asynchronous Task Processing","Reliability","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a persistent message published to a durable RabbitMQ queue is successfully recovered and processed after a broker restart, and a failed message is routed to the DLQ.","Critical - Failure means loss of critical data like study metadata or print jobs (RISK-007).","High","RabbitMQ and a test database are running (preferably in Docker via Testcontainers).","1. Programmatically declare a durable queue with DLQ configuration. 2. Publish a persistent message. 3. Stop and restart the RabbitMQ container. 4. Start a consumer and verify it receives and processes the message. 5. Publish a new message. 6. Start a consumer that intentionally throws an exception and NACKs the message. 7. Verify the message is present in the DLQ.","Messages are not lost during broker restarts, and unprocessable messages are isolated in the DLQ for manual intervention.","Serialized test command object.","Testcontainers, RabbitMQ.Client, xUnit, .NET Test Host","2","12","4","TASK-003","CI environment with Docker support.","Message is successfully consumed after restart.

Start monitoring client UI responsiveness (e.g., using a separate lightweight process). 2. Use a DICOM test tool (e.g., a custom `fo-dicom` script) to initiate 10 concurrent C-STORE associations, each sending a moderately sized study. 3. During the transfer, perform standard actions in the client UI. 4. Measure and record the UI response times and C-STORE completion times.","The system ingests all studies successfully while UI response times for common actions remain under 500ms.","At least 10 unique DICOM studies of ~100MB each.","JMeter (or custom script) for load generation, `fo-dicom` library, New Relic/Prometheus for monitoring.","4","24","10","REQ-1-078","Dedicated performance testing environment.","Handles 10+ concurrent associations.
