"Phase 1 - Core Foundation (Sprints 1-3)","High","6","150","xUnit, Moq, Appium/WinAppDriver, Testcontainers","250","Very High - Enables CI/CD and foundational regression testing.","5 hours/sprint","24","CI pipeline setup, Testcontainers for PostgreSQL, Test PACS (Orthanc) setup.","98% pass rate on automated regression suite. CI pipeline execution time < 15 minutes.","WPF automation stability with WinAppDriver. Test environment setup complexity.","Use stable IDs for UI elements. Use Docker for reproducible test environments.","Enables rapid, reliable feedback for core security and DICOM features."
"Phase 2 - Viewer & Advanced Features (Sprints 4-6)","Medium","6","200","Appium/WinAppDriver, Visual Studio Profiler","350","Medium - Reduces extensive manual viewer testing.","10 hours/sprint","8","Dedicated performance testing hardware.","Automated performance benchmarks for viewer are established. 80% of viewer tools are covered by automated tests.","Difficulty in automating complex visual interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, annotations).","Focus automation on data validation rather than pixel-perfect rendering. Supplement with manual exploratory testing.","Improves quality and performance of the core clinical user experience."
