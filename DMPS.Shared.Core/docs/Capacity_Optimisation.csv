"Cross-training","Junior developer is underutilized in early sprints while senior backend developer is a bottleneck.","Assign junior developer to pair program with the senior backend dev on messaging (WI-003) and persistence (WI-022) components. Assign specific, mentored tasks like WI-021 and WI-023.","Accelerates junior developer's learning curve, reduces senior's workload on simpler tasks, and mitigates key-person dependency risk.","25.6","8 weeks","Junior developer can independently complete medium-complexity backend tasks by Sprint 6.","Increased team velocity and reduced risk worth an estimated 1.5x the cost of mentorship time."
"Resource Leveling","Project plan shows frontend capacity is high in early sprints while backend is constrained.","Pull forward UI-heavy administrative tasks (e.g., UI for Hanging Protocol configuration) from later sprints into Sprints 2-3, using mocked data services until the backend is ready.","Levels resource utilization across the team, makes earlier progress on UI features, and reduces idle time for frontend developers.","8","On-going","More balanced utilization percentages for frontend and backend roles across the project timeline.","Prevents context switching and improves overall project flow."
