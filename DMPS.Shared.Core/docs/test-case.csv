"TEST-SEC-001","Auditing & Compliance","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that logging an object containing Protected Health Information (PHI) results in the PHI being redacted in all log sinks.","Critical - Failure to redact PHI from logs is a HIPAA violation and a severe data breach.","High","Serilog is configured with the custom PHI redaction enricher. Test environment has access to log file and Windows Event Log.","1. In an integration test, instantiate a service that uses the configured logger. 2. Create a C# object with properties matching PHI (e.g., PatientName, PatientID). 3. Log a message with the object using structured logging (e.g., `Log.Information(""Processing {@Patient}"", patientObject)`). 4. Read the contents of the output log file and the corresponding Windows Event Log entry.","The log output in both the file and Event Log must contain placeholder text (e.g., '[REDACTED]') instead of the actual PHI values. The rest of the log message should be intact.","Sample C# objects representing data with PHI.","xUnit, Serilog, Test Log Sinks","4","10","3","Serilog configuration, custom PHI redaction logic.","Integration test environment.","100% of defined PHI fields are redacted. No performance degradation in logging.","Critical - HIPAA compliance failure.","Every release.","Low","Delete test log files.","The redaction logic itself must undergo a security code review.","Redaction should add less than 5ms overhead per log event.","N/A"
"TEST-PERF-001","Advanced DICOM Viewer","Performance","System","High","true","Medium","Measure the time taken to load a large DICOM study (500MB) and verify the UI remains responsive during manipulation.","High - A slow, unresponsive viewer will be rejected by clinical users and makes the product unusable for its primary purpose.","High","A 500MB+ DICOM CT study is available in the test database. The test machine meets the 'recommended' hardware specification.","1. Start a stopwatch. 2. In the application, double-click the target study to open it in the viewer. 3. Stop the stopwatch when the low-resolution preview is rendered. Record time. 4. Verify full-resolution image loads. 5. Perform rapid zoom, pan, and WW/WL adjustments. 6. Measure UI thread responsiveness.","The initial study load time (to low-res preview) must be less than 3 seconds. The UI response time for manipulation actions must be under 500ms.

"TEST-DICOM-001","DICOM Core Functionality","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end asynchronous DICOM C-STORE ingestion pipeline.","Critical - If the system cannot reliably receive DICOM studies, it fails at its most fundamental purpose.","High","Windows Service is running. RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL are running and configured. A test DICOM study is available on disk.","1. Use a DICOM toolkit (e.g., dcmtk's `storescu`) to send the test study to the application's C-STORE SCP. 2. Verify `storescu` receives a success response. 3. Monitor the RabbitMQ management UI to confirm a message appears in the main processing queue and is consumed. 4. Query the PostgreSQL database to verify that records for Patient, Study, Series, and Image have been created correctly. 5. Check the configured storage path on the file system to verify the DICOM files are stored in the correct hierarchical structure.","The study is successfully transmitted, queued, processed, and persisted to both the database and file system.

"TEST-RELIABILITY-001","Core Architecture","Reliability","System","High","","Low","Verify the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) mechanism correctly handles persistent message processing failures.","High - A single failing message could block the processing queue, halting all asynchronous operations (e.g., all new studies stop being saved).","Medium","Windows Service, RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL are running. A message that will cause a persistent failure (e.g., malformed data) is ready to be published.","1. Publish the poison message to the main processing queue. 2. Observe the service logs to see it attempt to process the message and fail. 3. Configure the consumer to retry 3 times. 4. After the 3rd failure, verify the message is removed from the main queue. 5. Check the RabbitMQ Management UI to confirm the message now exists in the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). 6. Verify an alert is triggered (if configured).","After exhausting retries, the poison message is successfully routed to the DLQ. The main processing queue is unblocked and can process subsequent valid messages.","A 'poison' message that is guaranteed to fail processing.","RabbitMQ client/Management UI, Log viewer","4","","","RabbitMQ DLX configuration, consumer retry logic.","Integration environment.","Poison message is successfully isolated in the DLQ.
