"Cross-training","Critical skill silos in DirectX and DICOM (1 developer each).","Formalize a bi-weekly, 4-hour pair programming session between senior.dev1 and senior.dev2 focused exclusively on the DICOM viewer and SCU service codebases.","Creates a viable backup resource, reducing key-person dependency risk by 50% over 3 months.","8","16 weeks","senior.dev2 can independently resolve a medium-complexity bug in the DICOM SCU service by Sprint 7.","Mitigates a potential 8-week project delay, valued at >$100,000 in resource and opportunity cost."
"Load Balancing","Senior developers have high utilization on critical path tasks, while mid-level developers have significant downtime in some sprints (e.g., Sprint 5).","Create a 'stretch task' backlog for mid-level developers, including writing integration tests for backend services, improving documentation, or developing proof-of-concepts for future features.","Increases overall team productivity by ~15% and accelerates skill development for mid-level team members.","2","Ongoing","Mid-level developer utilization remains above 40% in all sprints.","Frees up ~10 hours of senior developer time per sprint by offloading testing and documentation tasks."
