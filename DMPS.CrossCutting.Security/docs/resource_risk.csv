"RISK-R001","Resource","Project relies on niche DirectX/HLSL and fo-dicom expertise held by a single developer (senior.dev1). Unavailability of this resource would halt critical path features (DICOM viewer, Q/R).","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-041"",""TASK-042"",""TASK-043"",""TASK-032"",""TASK-039""]","8","1. Mandate pair programming between senior.dev1 and senior.dev2 on all DirectX and fo-dicom tasks. 2. Enforce high documentation standards for these modules. 3. Allocate 10% of senior.dev2's capacity to cross-training.","Pre-vet an external contractor with DirectX expertise. If senior.dev1 is lost, engage contractor and accept a 4-week project delay for onboarding.","senior.dev2 has not co-authored any commits in the graphics or DICOM modules for two consecutive sprints.","40000","Ongoing"
"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","The two mid-level developers have strong WPF/MVVM skills but limited exposure to complex backend services, security, and messaging. This could slow down integration tasks and increase defects.","Medium","Medium","[""TASK-012"",""TASK-125""]","2","Implement a formal mentorship program where each mid-level dev is paired with a senior dev. Require mid-level devs to perform initial code reviews on non-critical backend PRs.","Re-allocate more complex integration tasks from mid-level to senior developers, accepting a potential delay in less critical features.","Integration bug count attributed to frontend developers exceeds 5 per sprint.","","Ongoing"
