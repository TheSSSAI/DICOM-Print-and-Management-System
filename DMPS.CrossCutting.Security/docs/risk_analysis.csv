"RISK-001","Technical","The core DICOM viewer's reliance on a low-level DirectX rendering pipeline via `Vortice.Windows` introduces significant technical complexity. A lack of specialized skills could lead to severe bugs like GPU resource leaks, rendering artifacts, instability, or major performance issues, jeopardizing the primary user-facing feature.","4","5","20","High","WI-035, WI-036, WI-037. Directly impacts the entire 'DICOM Viewer' epic (EPIC-006) and the application's clinical usability.","Choice of a high-performance but highly complex technology stack for the rendering pipeline, which requires specialized skills beyond standard WPF/.NET development.","1. Prioritize staffing a developer with proven graphics programming (DirectX/HLSL) experience. 2. Enforce rigorous code reviews and pair programming for all rendering code. 3. Implement extensive unit and integration tests for GPU resource management to detect leaks early.","Develop a simpler, fallback rendering path using WPF's built-in capabilities (e.g., `WriteableBitmap`). If the DirectX implementation proves too unstable or time-consuming, pivot to this fallback to ensure basic functionality, accepting a performance trade-off.","Memory profiler shows GPU resource allocation consistently increasing during a test session. Milestone for a basic rendered image is delayed by more than 2 sprints.","Lead Developer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","The DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE functionality's success is highly dependent on interoperability with various external PACS vendors. Subtle differences in DICOM protocol implementation can lead to connection failures or query errors at customer sites, rendering a key feature unusable.","4","4","16","High","WI-030, WI-064. Affects the 'DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE SCU Implementation' workstream and overall system integration capabilities.","The DICOM standard allows for vendor-specific variations and interpretations, making universal compatibility a persistent challenge in healthcare IT.","1. Create an integration test suite using multiple open-source PACS (e.g., Orthanc, dcm4chee) to test against different implementations. 2. Implement exceptionally detailed, configurable logging for all DICOM communication to aid remote debugging of on-site issues.","Develop a comprehensive DICOM troubleshooting guide for administrators. Allocate developer time in post-launch sprints specifically for resolving customer-specific PACS integration problems.","Integration tests fail against one or more of the test PACS environments. The first on-site deployment encounters a previously unseen connectivity issue.","QA Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The automated PHI redaction mechanism for logging may fail to catch all variations of patient data. An incomplete implementation would lead to sensitive PHI being written to log files, representing a critical HIPAA compliance violation and a major security breach.","3","5","15","High","WI-003. A cross-cutting concern affecting all parts of the application that perform logging.","Reliance on a single method of redaction (e.g., pattern matching) that may not cover all edge cases or custom data fields containing PHI.","1. Implement multi-layered redaction logic (by known DICOM tag, by regex patterns, and context-aware scrubbing). 2. Conduct a formal security review and penetration test focused specifically on log data exfiltration. 3. Use static analysis tools to find all logging statements and manually verify their safety.","In case of a suspected breach, have a documented incident response plan that includes immediate log quarantine, system shutdown procedures, and stakeholder notification protocols. Be prepared to deploy a hotfix that disables verbose logging.","A manual or automated audit of log files reveals any unmasked PHI. A security scan flags a logging statement as potentially unsafe.","Security Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","The application's stability is critically dependent on externally managed instances of PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ. Misconfiguration, version incompatibility, or poor performance of these services, which are outside the application's direct control, will cause a total application outage.","4","4","16","High","WI-013, WI-019, WI-069. Affects the entire system's ability to start up and function.","The client-server architecture has hard dependencies on third-party middleware that is not bundled with the application, shifting responsibility for its maintenance to the deploying organization.","1. The prerequisite checker (WI-069) must be robust, testing not just connectivity but also specific features like the `pgcrypto` extension. 2. Provide a comprehensive Deployment Guide (REQ-1-089) with specific version requirements and configuration checklists. 3. The System Health Dashboard (WI-062) must provide clear, actionable status indicators.","The application must fail gracefully on startup with clear error messages pointing to the likely source of the problem (e.g., ""Cannot connect to PostgreSQL database at server:port. Please check network connectivity and credentials.""). The Administrator's Guide must have a detailed troubleshooting section for these specific dependencies.","The System Health Dashboard shows a 'Disconnected' status for either PostgreSQL or RabbitMQ. The application fails to start, logging a connection error.","DevOps Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The DICOM ingest process involves separate database and filesystem operations. A failure after the database record is created but before the file is moved results in data inconsistency (orphaned DB records), violating data integrity and causing application errors when accessing missing files.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-027. This is the core of the data ingestion pipeline.","Lack of a distributed transaction mechanism that spans both the database and the filesystem, creating a window for failure between the two operations.","Implement a transactional outbox pattern: the file move operation is written as a record to a database table within the same transaction as the metadata. A separate, reliable worker process reads this table and executes the file moves, guaranteeing that the operation will eventually complete. The existing data integrity check task (WI-018) serves as a final verification.","If an inconsistency is detected, the system must prevent access to the corrupted study. The data integrity report must provide enough information for an administrator to attempt manual recovery from the temporary file storage location.","The data integrity check task (WI-018) logs a discrepancy between a database record and a file on disk. A user reports an error when trying to open a newly received study.","Backend Lead","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Timeline","The automated data retention and auto-purge task presents a significant risk of catastrophic, irreversible data loss if bugs exist in its logic. The need for extremely cautious development and exhaustive testing for this feature could consume more time than allocated, delaying project completion.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-066. A critical administrative feature with high potential for damage.","The feature is designed to perform destructive, automated actions on production data, which requires a much higher standard of quality assurance than typical features.","1. The feature MUST include a ""dry run"" mode that only logs what it *would* delete. 2. Implement a two-stage deletion: first, a soft delete (marking records for deletion), followed by a hard delete after a configurable grace period (e.g., 30 days). 3. Require a mandatory, two-person code review for any changes in this module.","Ensure the automated database backup strategy (WI-017) is fully implemented and tested before deploying the auto-purge feature. The official recovery plan must specifically include a procedure for restoring data that was accidentally purged by this task.","The number of items in the ""dry run"" report unexpectedly spikes or includes data that should not be deleted. Any user reports that data has disappeared unexpectedly.","Lead Developer","2025-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-007","External","The application's core business logic is gated by the external Odoo licensing API. An extended outage of this third-party service could force all customer installations into a restricted read-only mode after the 72-hour grace period expires, causing widespread operational disruption.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-070, WI-071. Affects application startup and access to key features like printing and exporting.","A business model dependency on a real-time, online validation service creates a single point of failure that is outside the project team's control.","1. The 72-hour grace period is the primary mitigation. 2. Implement robust client-side caching of the last valid license status. 3. Provide very clear UI messaging to users and administrators about the connectivity status and time remaining in the grace period.","Establish a formal Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the Odoo service provider. In the event of an extended outage, have a documented process to generate and securely distribute emergency, time-limited offline license files.","Application instances start reporting grace period warnings. The internal monitoring system detects that the Odoo API endpoint is unreachable for more than one hour.","Project Manager","2025-08-31","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","The project relies on niche expertise in DirectX/HLSL and the `fo-dicom` library. If the primary developer with these skills becomes unavailable, finding a replacement would be difficult and time-consuming, causing severe delays to critical path features.","2","5","10","Medium","EPIC-005, EPIC-006. Halts or severely slows progress on all core DICOM functionality.","Key person dependency due to the selection of specialized, complex technologies that require a steep learning curve.","1. Institute mandatory pair programming sessions for all work on the DICOM viewer and communication services. 2. Enforce a high standard of code documentation and comments in these modules. 3. Actively cross-train at least one other developer to a proficient level on these technologies.","Identify and pre-vet external contractors or consultants with the required skills who could be engaged on short notice if the primary resource is lost. Build a buffer into the project timeline for the DICOM-related epics.","The primary specialist is the only one contributing code to the `fo-dicom` or `Vortice.Windows` integration points for two consecutive sprints. No one else on the team can answer technical questions about these modules.","Development Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
